Hey kids, I am Epsilon the Dragon! Let us explore number sets together! POOF! Natural numbers one, two, three appear as counting cookies. These are for counting my dragon treats! But wait, Zero appears. I am special! Then negative numbers show up as ice cubes, minus one, minus two, minus three. Together, we are Integers! WHOOSH! Fractions fly in as pizza slices, one half, three quarters. We are Rational numbers – any fraction! Suddenly, the square root of two appears as an infinite spiral dragon. I am Irrational – my decimal never repeats! Pi flies by, leaving an infinite trail. Together they form the Real Number Line. Absolute value measures distance from zero, like dragon hugs, always positive! Intervals are dragon territories – some include endpoints, others do not! Bounded sets have limits, like a dragon playpen with walls. For any epsilon greater than zero, we can get closer than epsilon!
