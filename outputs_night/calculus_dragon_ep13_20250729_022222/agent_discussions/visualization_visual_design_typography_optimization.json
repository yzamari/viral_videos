          "message": "For this 'Dragon Detective Agency' episode, the visual design must perfectly blend Family Guy's comedic aesthetic with the systematic nature of function analysis. The 3-second animated title card needs to be impactful with 'epic effects' that hint at both dragons and investigation, setting a strong visual tone. Subsequent visuals should use clear, engaging metaphors like a detective examining clues for domain, or a dragon's 'mood swings' representing concavity, all within the 40-second Instagram timeframe.",

The Family Guy style animation, combined with strong typographic elements for the title card, will immediately capture attention.  The systematic function analysis must be broken down into digestible, visually driven segments, using the detective metaphor to maintain viewer interest and aid comprehension.",
