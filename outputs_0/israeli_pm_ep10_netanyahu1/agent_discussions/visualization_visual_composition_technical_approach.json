Each narrative beat will be visually distinct and energetically presented with impactful sound design and concise, powerful voiceovers, mirroring the pacing and drama of a Marvel comic. The visual composition will prioritize dynamic angles, bold text overlays, and specific comic-book-style effects to amplify the emotional impact of each 'origin' moment, driving home the persona's journey with a sense of epic progression.",
