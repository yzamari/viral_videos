    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate precisely 3 seconds for the animated title card, ensuring it's visually stunning and immediately grabs attention. Use an epic, dragon-themed sound effect for this segment., For the function explanations, each concept (transformation rules, domain/range, etc.) should be condensed into 1-2 sentences each, with a corresponding visual metaphor that lasts for the duration of the explanation (approx. 3-5 seconds per concept)., Allocate approximately 4-5 seconds per function concept to allow for visual setup and the comedic punchline, while keeping the dialogue extremely tight.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting all the specified function concepts into the remaining ~37 seconds after the 3-second title card, requiring extremely efficient scripting and visual pacing.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the required function concepts (transformation rules, domain/range, one-to-one, onto, bijections, composition, even/odd, periodic) into the ~35 seconds remaining after the title card, without sacrificing clarity or humor. Each topic needs to be distilled to its absolute essence.",
      "The biggest concern is fitting all the requested function concepts (transformation rules, domain/range, one-to-one, onto, bijections, composition, even/odd, periodic) into a 40-second video. Each concept needs to be explained and visualized, which will require extremely efficient scripting and animation."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Allocate 1 second per function concept for rapid-fire delivery and visual payoff, ensuring the title card takes exactly 3 seconds.",
      "For the function explanations, each concept (transformation rules, domain/range, etc.) should be condensed into 1-2 sentences each, with a corresponding visual metaphor that lasts for the duration of the explanation (approx. 3-5 seconds per concept).",
      "Incorporate short, punchy sound effects and comedic interjections from the baby dragon to maintain the Family Guy style and pacing.",
      "Ensure the animated title card is visually stunning and immediately sets the comedic, educational tone.",
      "The 'dragon transformation machine' should be the central visual element for transformation rules, with the dragon physically changing states, clearly showing input and output. For domain and range, 'territory maps' where the dragon can explore, marking allowed inputs and reachable outputs, would be effective.",
      "Develop distinct, quick visual metaphors for each function type (e.g., transformation machine for rules, territory maps for domain/range, mirrored dragon for even/odd functions) to reinforce learning instantly.",
