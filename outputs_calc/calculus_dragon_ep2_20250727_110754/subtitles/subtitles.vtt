00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
All aboard the Sequence Express!

00:01.600 --> 00:01.920
Each

00:01.920 --> 00:04.704
car represents a , a₂, a₃…

00:04.704 --> 00:05.232
CHOO CHOO!

00:05.232 --> 00:06.288
We are headed to

00:06.288 --> 00:06.976
the limit.

00:06.976 --> 00:08.352
This train journey approaches

00:08.352 --> 00:09.312
station L.

00:09.312 --> 00:11.232
Convergence means approaching closer

00:11.232 --> 00:12.192
and closer.

00:12.192 --> 00:14.112
The Epsilon tunnel brings

00:14.112 --> 00:14.812
us within epsilon of L.

00:14.812 --> 00:14.952
What

00:14.952 --> 00:16.064
a feat!

00:16.064 --> 00:18.288
The unique limit theorem

00:18.288 --> 00:19.232
guarantees only one destination.

00:19.232 --> 00:19.704
No detours

00:19.704 --> 00:20.912
are permitted.

00:20.912 --> 00:23.328
Bounded sequences remain on

00:23.328 --> 00:24.788
track, never straying too far.

00:24.788 --> 00:25.080
They

00:25.080 --> 00:27.384
are dependable travelers.

00:27.384 --> 00:29.688
The arithmetic of

00:29.688 --> 00:31.320
limits functions , multiplication, all
work

00:31.320 --> 00:32.136
perfectly.

00:32.136 --> 00:35.400
It is mathematical magic!

00:35.400 --> 00:36.216
The

00:36.216 --> 00:37.722
Sandwich theorem is a delightful delicious
sequence sandwich!

00:37.722 --> 00:38.664
Even epsilon chicks converge beautifully
