1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,719
Welcome aboard the Number Train.

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:02,063
Our

3
00:00:02,363 --> 00:00:05,733
baby dragon conductor leads us to

4
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:07,587
a special station.

5
00:00:07,587 --> 00:00:09,142
Each train car

6
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,348
shows a sequence number, getting closer.

7
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:12,772
This demonstrates convergence.

8
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:13,895
See the tiny

9
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:15,092
epsilon tunnels?

10
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:16,886
They illustrate how numbers

11
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:18,648
approach the limit.

12
00:00:18,648 --> 00:00:20,111
Bounds keep our

13
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:21,935
train on track, within limits.

14
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:22,240
No

15
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,094
derailing is allowed.

16
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:25,648
These math lessons

17
00:00:25,948 --> 00:00:26,883
make sequences and limits clear.

18
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:28,378
We have learned about sequences and their
limits
