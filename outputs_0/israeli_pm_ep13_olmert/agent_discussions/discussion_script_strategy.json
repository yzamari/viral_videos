    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Utilize quick cuts between stylized comic panels, each depicting a key event (e.g., Olmert's surprise, the Lebanon War 'BOOM! CRASH!', the 'SHIELD-style' interrogation)., Incorporate on-screen text mimicking comic book sound effects ('POW!', 'CLANK!', 'CHA-CHING!') synchronized with audio and visuals for maximum impact and readability., Segment the script into 8-10 extremely short, visually dynamic comic book panels (2-3 seconds each). For instance, the 'spider-bite style' could be a quick zoom on Olmert's hand with a subtle, creepy sound, followed immediately by his panicked line.",
