The audio must mirror the chaotic energy of the show, with distinct vocalizations for each character, ensuring Maryam's slurring and the official's deadpan delivery are clear and impactful within the 40-second window.",

Maryam's slurred delivery needs to be clearly annunciated for maximum comedic effect, while the 'Chris-style official' should be delivered with a deadpan dryness to amplify the absurdity of his statement. Sound design should punctuate the quick visual gags, ensuring every beat lands within the 40-second constraint.",
