Each action sequence needs to be extremely brief, leveraging striking comic-book-style visuals and synchronized sound effects as the primary drivers of viewer retention and impact. The goal is to create a relentless, high-octane visual experience that feels like a condensed Marvel trailer.",

The technical approach should leverage dynamic camera angles, exaggerated comic book motion graphics (like comic smoke and lightning), and precise syncing of sound effects to visuals to maximize the high-impact, punchy feel essential for Instagram engagement within the 35-second window. This approach will enhance its viral potential through sheer spectacle and adherence to the platform's short-form video expectations.",

The dialogue needs a powerful, slightly distorted comic-villain tone to cut through the sound design, anchoring the rapid-fire events and enhancing the over-the-top, comedic-action feel.",
