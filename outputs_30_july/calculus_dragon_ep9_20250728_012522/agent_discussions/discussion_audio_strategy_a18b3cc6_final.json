    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For audio, we need a 'Family Guy' style voice actor who can deliver lines with a similar cadence and comedic timing to characters like Peter Griffin, with the ability to shift tone to explain the math without breaking character. Exaggerated sound effects for treasure finding, dragon movements, and comedic payoffs are crucial for the humor and pacing, especially for demonstrating instantaneous rate of change (dragon velocity) and the relationship between differentiability and continuity (smooth vs. jagged flight paths)., Focus on visual metaphors for each concept: Extreme Value Theorem as finding the highest/lowest pile of gold in a cave (closed interval), monotonic bijections as a treasure map always leading to a predictably increasing treasure value, Heine-Cantor as a treasure chest that always reveals gold consistently, and derivatives as the dragon's speedometer showing its immediate speed or the steepness of a treasure-laden cliff., To ensure the 35s \u00b15% compliance, script segments should be max two short sentences (1-2 lines of subtitles each). Each segment needs to be precisely timed to allow for the comedic beats and visual transitions.  Allocate approximately 8-10 seconds for establishing the premise and character, then 4-5 seconds per mathematical concept, with a final 5-7 seconds for the differentiability/continuity link.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is the sheer volume of mathematical concepts to cover within 35 seconds without sacrificing clarity or humor. It will be challenging to explain Extreme Value Theorem, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor theorem, and derivatives with their associated visual metaphors and comedic beats without feeling rushed or losing clarity.",
      "The primary concern remains fitting all the complex mathematical concepts, including monotonic bijections and the Heine-Cantor theorem, into the 35-second window without overwhelming the audience or sacrificing humor and clarity.",
      "Maintaining the 'Family Guy style' humor while also accurately (albeit simplified) explaining calculus concepts is a delicate balance. Over-simplification could render the math incorrect, while too much detail will alienate viewers and exceed the time.",
      "The biggest concern is cramming all these distinct mathematical concepts into 35 seconds without them feeling rushed or conflated. Each concept needs just enough visual and dialogue to register, which is extremely challenging."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "For the Extreme Value Theorem, visualize the dragon trying to physically grab the absolute highest gold coin from a precarious pile (max) and the lowest, dust-covered coin (min) within a confined cave (closed interval).",
      "Show the dragon's flight as a speedometer displaying instantaneous speed (derivative) and its smooth, uninterrupted flight path across a treasure map segment for uniform continuity, contrasting it with a jagged, broken flight path for non-differentiability.",
      "The Heine-Cantor theorem could be shown with the dragon consistently finding a predictable amount of treasure each time it opens a 'magical' chest, regardless of its slight adjustments in approach.",

      "Focus on visual metaphors for each concept: Extreme Value Theorem as finding the highest/lowest pile of gold in a cave (closed interval), monotonic bijections as a treasure map always leading to a predictably increasing treasure value, Heine-Cantor as a treasure chest that always reveals gold consistently, and derivatives as the dragon's speedometer showing its immediate speed or the steepness of a treasure-laden cliff.",
      "Visualizing continuity and differentiability will involve contrasting the dragon's smooth flight path to a treasure with a jerky, interrupted flight that abruptly jumps or stops, clearly showing differentiable vs. non-differentiable points.",
      "To maximize viral potential and engagement on Instagram, the core humor needs to be universally understandable, even if the math is a bit niche. Think quick cuts, punchy one-liners, and visually striking metaphors that viewers can easily share and discuss.  The 'instantaneous rate of change' via dragon velocity can be a strong visual hook.",
      "For the Extreme Value Theorem, we'll show the dragon enthusiastically digging through a treasure pile, with a visual indicator highlighting the absolute highest (max) and lowest (min) gems found within a defined cavern (closed interval).",
      "For monotonic bijection, depict a treasure map that always points to a unique, increasingly valuable treasure chest as the dragon follows its path.",
      "Ensure the audio pace is frenetic, matching the Family Guy style, with distinct sound cues for each math concept's reveal.",
      "To illustrate derivatives, we'll use a 'dragon speed-o-meter' on its neck, showing instantaneous velocity as it flies uphill (positive derivative) or downhill (negative derivative) towards treasure, with the steepness of the slope correlating to the rate of change.",
      "To ensure the 35s \u00b15% compliance, script segments should be max two short sentences (1-2 lines of subtitles each). Each segment needs to be precisely timed to allow for the comedic beats and visual transitions.  Allocate approximately 8-10 seconds for establishing the premise and character, then 4-5 seconds per mathematical concept, with a final 5-7 seconds for the differentiability/continuity link."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To create an engaging Family Guy-style comedy on Instagram about these dense calculus concepts, we must prioritize rapid visual gags and simplified, relatable metaphors for each theorem. The dragon treasure hunter persona should be the anchor, with each mathematical concept intrinsically linked to a treasure-hunting scenario to maintain narrative flow and humor.",
      "To make this Family Guy-style calculus comedy engaging for Instagram within 35 seconds, we need to deliver rapid-fire visual gags directly tied to the treasure hunting theme for each mathematical concept. Prioritize visual metaphors that are instantly understandable, like the dragon's speed for derivatives and flight path variations for continuity/differentiability, ensuring the humor lands while conveying the core idea.",
      "To synchronize our efforts for this Family Guy-style calculus comedy, we must prioritize visual metaphors that are both humorous and immediately convey the core mathematical concept. The treasure hunting theme provides a fantastic vehicle for visualizing derivatives as dragon velocity and continuity/differentiability through flight path smoothness."

  "key_insights": [
    "Given the extremely tight 35-second duration and the platform's fast-paced nature, the success hinges on visually translating complex ideas into instantly understandable jokes. The dragon's adventures must serve as the primary vehicle for explaining Extreme Value Theorem, continuity, and derivatives.",
    "Instagram audiences have short attention spans, especially for educational content. A tight, visually driven narrative with clear, comedic representations of complex math will maximize engagement and retention within the strict time limit.",
    "Our collective goal is to deliver dense information within a tight, comedic format. By focusing on the treasure hunting narrative as the primary driver for visual explanations, we ensure clarity and engagement on Instagram, crucial for a 35-second runtime."
