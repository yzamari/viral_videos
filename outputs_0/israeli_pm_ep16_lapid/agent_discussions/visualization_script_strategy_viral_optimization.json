We'll leverage exaggerated sound effects and quick cuts to emphasize each narrative beat, from the 'Spider-Man arrival' hook to the satirical 'thirst trap' outro, ensuring maximum engagement and shareability within the 65-second timeframe.",

          "message": "To accomplish this mission, we will construct a fast-paced, visually dynamic Instagram reel that employs rapid cuts, exaggerated meme-like visuals, and sharp sound design to tell a compressed political narrative. The strategy hinges on leveraging universally recognizable visual tropes and concise, punchy dialogue to highlight the perceived meteoric rise and fall, culminating in a darkly humorous, self-aware post-credit scene. This approach will maximize engagement by mirroring the ephemeral, meme-driven nature of online political discourse, making the satire impactful and highly shareable.",

The key is aggressive pacing, punchy audio-visual synchronization, and strategically timed visual gags that mirror the requested narrative arc, all culminating in a self-aware, darkly humorous post-credit scene designed for maximum shareability and impact. We will employ a 'show, don't tell' approach, using visual cues and sound design to convey emotion and narrative progression efficiently within the 65-second window.",
