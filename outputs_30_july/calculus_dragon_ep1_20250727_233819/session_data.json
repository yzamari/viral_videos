  "mission": "Create a Family Guy style educational comedy where baby dragon professor Epsilon teaches number sets. Cover natural numbers, integers, rational and irrational numbers, the real number line, absolute value, intervals, bounded sets, and supremum. Use visual metaphors: counting cookies for natural numbers, ice cubes for negative numbers, pizza slices for fractions, infinite spiral for irrational numbers. Make it funny and engaging for calculus students while teaching key concepts. The dragon should have a comedic personality and use humor to explain mathematical concepts.",

[VISUAL: Epsilon adds melting ice cubes to the cookie pile] DIALOGUE: But oops, a mishap! Enter the integers, including these chilly negative numbers. [VISUAL: Epsilon cuts a pizza into slices] DIALOGUE: For pizza slices, we need rational numbers, tasty fractions all around. [VISUAL: An impossibly complex, shimmering spiral appears] DIALOGUE: Beware the infinite spiral of irrational numbers; pi and its pals are quite the tricksters. [VISUAL: Epsilon gestures to a vast real number line stretching into the distance] DIALOGUE: All together, they form the vast real number line, a universe of possibilities!",
    "final_script": "Greetings, fledgling mathematicians! Today, we explore natural numbers, counting cookies. A mishap occurs; we encounter integers, including negative numbers. For pizza slices, we need rational numbers - fractions. Beware irrational numbers like pi; they are infinite. All these numbers form the real number line, a universe of possibilities",
