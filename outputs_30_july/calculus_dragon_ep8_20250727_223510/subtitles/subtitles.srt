1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,201
Alright, Stewie, buckle up.

2
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,403
We are learning about

3
00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:03,128
limits, dragon-style.

4
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,302
Limits are like a smooth flight,

5
00:00:05,302 --> 00:00:07,248
not that teleporting nonsense.

6
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:09,195
We approach our destination

7
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:09,498
smoothly.

8
00:00:09,498 --> 00:00:11,017
A perfect landing is continuity;

9
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:11,624
from any

10
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:12,865
direction, we arrive smoothly.

11
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:14,106
Epsilon-delta means getting our

12
00:00:14,106 --> 00:00:16,692
flight path very close to the target
altitude.

13
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:21,368
One-sided limits are like approaching a
landing strip

14
00:00:21,368 --> 00:00:24,875
from the left or the right.

15
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,044
A sudden

16
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:27,467
jump indicates a discontinuity.

17
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:28,891
No teleporting is allowed

18
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:29,195
mid-flight.

19
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,320
Continuity means our flight is a single,

20
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,195
unbroken path.

21
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:34,821
The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees
we

22
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:39,784
can fly to any altitude between two points
