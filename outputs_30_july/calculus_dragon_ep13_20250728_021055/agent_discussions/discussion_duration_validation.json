    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Employ exaggerated 'case file' visuals for each step of function analysis (e.g., domain as 'the boundaries of the crime scene', critical points as 'suspects')., Use fast-paced cuts between the dragon's dialogue and visual representations of the functions, mirroring the quick wit of Family Guy., Visual gag idea: The 'domain' is the detective's crime scene tape, surrounding the function's possible values. A function with a restricted domain might have the tape blocking off certain areas, leading to a comedic dead-end for the detective.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is cramming the entire systematic function analysis process into an unknown, but likely short, Instagram video without overwhelming the audience or losing the comedic tone.",
      "The primary concern is fitting the entire systematic function analysis into a concise, potentially under-35-second format without sacrificing clarity or comedic timing, especially when covering multiple calculus concepts.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the complex mathematical steps with the rapid-fire comedic pacing required for Instagram. Each step must be explained succinctly and visually to avoid overwhelming viewers, especially with the 'unknown duration' constraint."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Use fast-paced cuts between the dragon's dialogue and visual representations of the functions, mirroring the quick wit of Family Guy.",
      "Assign each mathematical concept (domain, derivatives, inflection points, asymptotes) a unique 'case file' or 'witness' the dragon detective interacts with, using distinct visual styles for each.",
      "Develop specific 'Family Guy-esque' visual metaphors for concavity, such as the dragon's fiery breath changing color or intensity based on the second derivative's sign.",
      "Employ exaggerated 'case file' visuals for each step of function analysis (e.g., domain as 'the boundaries of the crime scene', critical points as 'suspects').",
      "Visual gag idea: 'Critical points' are potential suspects, identified by the dragon's 'first derivative breath' that causes them to visibly shake (indicating a change in direction/slope). Second derivative tests could be the detective's 'mood swing meter,' showing if the function's behavior is speeding up or slowing down its change.",
      "Visual gag idea: The 'domain' is the detective's crime scene tape, surrounding the function's possible values. A function with a restricted domain might have the tape blocking off certain areas, leading to a comedic dead-end for the detective."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To make this Family Guy-style comedy engaging on Instagram and effectively teach function analysis within a tight, unknown duration, we must prioritize rapid-fire visual gags and clear, concise explanations delivered by the dragon detective. The comedic timing and visual metaphors are paramount for memorability and virality.",
      "To maximize engagement for this Family Guy-style function analysis on Instagram, we must ensure every visual gag directly supports the mathematical concept being explained. The dragon detective's 'case files' can be the functions, with each investigative step (domain, derivatives, etc.) being a clue or suspect. This keeps the narrative focused and the humor relevant.",
      "To ensure this Family Guy-style function analysis comedy is engaging on Instagram and memorable, we must synchronize the detective's investigation steps with distinct visual gags and rapid-fire dialogue.  Each mathematical concept should be a 'clue' or a 'suspect' within a mini-case file, with the dragon detective's 'mood swings' directly illustrating concavity changes for maximum comedic and educational impact."

  "key_insights": [
    "Instagram thrives on quick, entertaining content. A character-driven, visually rich approach like the dragon detective investigating functions will capture attention, while precise scripting ensures the educational content is digestible without sacrificing humor.",
    "By tightly integrating the comedy with the educational content, we create a memorable and effective learning experience. The visual metaphors of detective work and mood swings for concavity are key to making abstract math concepts relatable and entertaining on a platform like Instagram.",
    "By mapping each analytical step to a narrative element of a detective case, we create a cohesive and entertaining structure.  This approach facilitates easy synchronization of visual and auditory elements, crucial for both comprehension and viral appeal on a platform like Instagram."
