00:00.000 --> 00:01.605
All aboard the SEQUENCE EXPRESS!

00:01.605 --> 00:02.247
Our first

00:02.247 --> 00:03.019
number is one.

00:03.019 --> 00:03.534
Next, one-half.

00:03.534 --> 00:04.049
Then, one-third.

00:04.049 --> 00:04.437
CHOO CHOO!

00:04.437 --> 00:05.407
Notice the pattern - each

00:05.407 --> 00:06.732
term follows a simple rule.

00:06.732 --> 00:07.262
We are

00:07.262 --> 00:08.188
approaching LIMIT STATION, zero.

00:08.188 --> 00:08.882
Convergence means we

00:08.882 --> 00:11.569
get increasingly closer to zero.

00:11.569 --> 00:12.643
After a

00:12.643 --> 00:15.752
certain point, all terms remain extremely
close

00:15.752 --> 00:16.737
to zero.

00:16.737 --> 00:19.200
The UNIQUE LIMIT THEOREM guarantees

00:19.200 --> 00:21.708
only one possible destination.

00:21.708 --> 00:23.589
If minus M

00:23.589 --> 00:27.585
is less than or equal to a

00:27.585 --> 00:31.795
sub n, the sequence is bounded.

00:31.795 --> 00:32.496
This

00:32.496 --> 00:34.847
convergence is fascinating, is it not?

00:34.847 --> 00:35.239
The

00:35.239 --> 00:38.583
elegance of mathematics is on full display

00:38.583 --> 00:39.396
here.

00:39.396 --> 00:44.278
We see the power of limits

00:44.278 --> 00:47.595
in action, approaching the destination
with unwavering

00:47.595 --> 00:48.289
precision.

00:48.289 --> 00:52.454
The journey itself is as remarkable

00:52.454 --> 00:53.484
as the destination.

00:53.484 --> 00:54.857
Observe how each step

00:54.857 --> 00:56.137
brings us closer, illustrating the concept
flawlessly.

00:56.137 --> 00:57.051
The precision is truly astounding.

00:57.051 --> 00:58.514
It is a beautiful illustration of
mathematical convergence
