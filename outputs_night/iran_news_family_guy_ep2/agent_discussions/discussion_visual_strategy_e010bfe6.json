For the Stewie-style minister's line, a subtle, slightly distorted vocal effect could add to the caricature., The 'COMMITTEE COUNT: \u221e' news ticker needs a distinct, repeating sound cue that builds in intensity or annoyance to match the visual. Maryam's eye twitch should be punctuated by a subtle, sharp 'pop' or 'click' sound effect., Allocate approximately 3-4 seconds for Maryam's initial announcement and the exploding org chart visual. The 'committee count: \u221e' ticker should be visible for at least 5 seconds. The Stewie-style minister cutaway needs about 5-6 seconds to land the joke with the nodding officials.
