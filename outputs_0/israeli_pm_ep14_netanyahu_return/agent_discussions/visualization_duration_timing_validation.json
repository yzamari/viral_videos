The 'Strange-style' time loop and 'Thanos-style' elements offer a perfect opportunity for quick cuts and dynamic transitions that will keep viewers locked in.  We must ensure each segment is punchy and visually distinct to maintain engagement.",

This demands extremely tight pacing, with each visual panel and corresponding audio bite lasting approximately 7-8 seconds to fit the total narrative arc within the 65-second goal. The 'TIME LOOP!' and 'Strange-style' elements are perfect for rapid, almost disorienting visual and auditory transitions that will keep viewers hooked.",
