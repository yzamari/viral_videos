      "message": "To accomplish the 'Marvel Comics origin' mission on Instagram within the target duration, we must strategically pace each narrative beat with impactful visuals and concise, punchy audio. Each segment needs to be timed precisely to build momentum, culminating in a strong emotional resonance that aligns with the user's desire for a dynamic portrayal of the requested persona's journey. The audio cues and voice acting will be critical in conveying the 'American swagger' and escalating 'RAGE MODE' to capture audience attention effectively.",

      "reasoning": "A strategic approach focusing on precise timing and impactful audio will ensure the narrative flow of the 'Marvel Comics origin' mission is compelling and memorable for an Instagram audience. By synchronizing distinct visual cues with powerful vocalizations and sound effects, we can create an engaging and emotionally resonant experience that adheres to the specified duration constraints, thereby fulfilling the mission's core objective.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds for the MIT graduation panel, ensuring the 'perfect English speech bubble' and 'American swagger lines' are delivered with strong vocal inflection and a subtle, energetic musical underscore. The 'MR. SECURITY' glowing effect should sync with a subtle power-up sound.",
        "Dedicate 5-7 seconds to the election panel, emphasizing the 'NARROW VICTORY!' with a sharp sound effect and a quick, triumphant sting. The visual should clearly show the slight margin of victory.",
        "Allocate 8-10 seconds for the Western Wall tunnel opening, using a dramatic 'WHOOSH' sound effect, unsettling ambient tones for the 'PORTAL TO CHAOS,' and a distinct 'dissolving' sound for the peace process, mirroring Spider-Man's disintegration with a subtle particle effect.",
        "Condense the scandal montage into 7-9 seconds, using rapid cuts with short, sharp audio cues like a cigar puff, champagne pop, and a distinct 'HULK SARA SMASH!' sound with a forceful voiceover. The 'RAGE MODE' should be visually and aurally intense.",
        "The coalition collapse and 'DISBANDING!' should be around 6-8 seconds, with heroic-sounding themes abruptly cutting out, replaced by a sense of fragmentation and defeat. Heroes scattering should be visually represented with quick motion.",
        "The landslide loss and 'I'LL BE BACK!' panel needs 5-7 seconds, using a defeated but defiant tone for the voiceover, accompanied by a somber soundscape that shifts to a determined beat. The visual should show a clear loss but hint at future resolve.",
        "The mirror practice panel, 'One day... LONGEST SERVING!', should be 4-6 seconds, with a focused, ambitious tone and a subtle, ascending musical motif.",
        "The post-credit tease can be a brief 2-3 seconds, with a final impactful sound effect or a whispered hint to leave the audience anticipating more."
      ],
      "concerns": [
        "The primary concern is maintaining a consistent 'Marvel Comics' tone and energy across diverse narrative elements within the tight time constraints. Ensuring seamless transitions between distinct emotional states (swagger, triumph, chaos, rage, defeat, ambition) requires meticulous audio mixing and voice direction.",
        "The exact word count per segment needs to be strictly managed to ensure each 1-2 sentence segment lands effectively for both audio and subtitle readability on Instagram. Overly long sentences or rushed delivery will break the immersion and dilute the impact."

This pacing will allow for impactful quick cuts, mirroring a comic book panel flow, and ensuring all key plot points are delivered crisply. We'll leverage distinct sound design and visual effects for each 'superpower' or pivotal moment, creating a dynamic and engaging viewing experience that fits the Marvel aesthetic.",

      "reasoning": "This approach directly addresses the mission's core request for a Marvel-style origin story by translating comic book panels into video segments. The defined segment timing ensures adherence to the overall duration constraint while allowing for the visual and auditory punch required for each distinct narrative beat, maximizing audience engagement on Instagram.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Allocate specific visual styles and sound effects to each 'power' or narrative beat: MIT graduation (clean, bright, authoritative), 'Mr. Security' (glowing, metallic, heroic sound), Election defeat (dramatic zoom, subtle 'whoosh' or 'crack'), Western Wall tunnel (dark, ethereal, 'portal' sound with particle effects), Scandal montage (fast cuts, champagne pop, sharp 'smash' sound), Coalition collapse (hero silhouettes scattering, 'disbanded' visual effect), Landslide loss (glitchy text, determined voiceover), Mirror practice (reflective visual, confident tone).",
        "Ensure the 'American swagger' is conveyed through confident vocal delivery and dynamic body language in the visual representations, particularly during the MIT graduation and 'Mr. Security' sequences. The 'HULK SARA SMASH!' moment requires a sharp, aggressive visual and auditory cue."
      ],
      "concerns": [
        "The primary concern is achieving the dramatic impact of each 'panel' within the very tight segment timings. Overlapping narrative beats or insufficient visual/audio cues could dilute the intended Marvel-esque feel and the persuasive storytelling."

        "Allocate 8-9 seconds for the Western Wall tunnel opening, emphasizing dynamic particle effects and a 'WHOOSH' sound for the escaping spirits to visually represent the dissolving peace process.",
        "Use a rapid montage of 3-4 seconds for each scandal panel (cigar, champagne, Sara's rage), with quick cuts and a 'HULK SARA SMASH!' sound effect to heighten the emotional impact.",
        "Allocate 6-7 seconds for the coalition collapse and landslide loss panels, using visuals of scattering figures and a determined 'I'LL BE BACK!' line.",
        "Conclude with 4-5 seconds for the mirror practice panel, showing determined practice for 'LONGEST SERVING!', followed by a very brief post-credit tease (1-2 seconds) for a potential sequel.",
        "Ensure all dialogue is kept to 1-2 sentences per segment, with each sentence approximately 10-15 words to facilitate clear, readable subtitles and natural speech breaks."

        "The primary concern is ensuring the tight timing for each segment while delivering the full narrative arc and emotional impact. Overly detailed visuals or dialogue could easily push the video over the allowed duration.",
        "Maintaining visual coherence and rapid transitions between distinct narrative beats (graduation, election, tunnels, scandals, collapse) on Instagram without appearing disjointed is a critical challenge."
