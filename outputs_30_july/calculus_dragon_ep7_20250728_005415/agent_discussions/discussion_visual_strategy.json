    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate 3-4 seconds max per function concept. For 'transformation rules and domain/range', show the dragon failing to transform into something outside its 'territory map' (e.g., a toaster), resulting in a funny malfunction of the 'dragon transformation machine'. This visual gag immediately clarifies the concept., Use distinct dragon forms for 'one-to-one' and 'onto' functions. For 'bijection', a quick sequence of unique, mapping transformations will suffice.  For 'function composition', show the output of one transformation becoming the input for another via the machine, perhaps leading to a chaotic, unexpected final form., Allocate roughly 3-4 seconds per function concept (domain/range, one-to-one, onto, bijections, composition, even/odd, periodic), ensuring the dragon's transformation failure or success is the immediate visual punchline, with minimal dialogue. For instance, domain/range could be the dragon trying to turn into something *off* the 'territory map' and exploding into goo.",

      "The biggest challenge is ensuring clarity of each mathematical concept while maintaining the rapid-fire comedic pacing required for Instagram. Cramming all the specified function types into 35 seconds risks overwhelming viewers or making explanations too superficial to be genuinely educational, even with the visual aids.",
      "The primary concern is the sheer density of function concepts to cover within 35 seconds. We must be ruthless in simplifying explanations and relying on visual gags to convey meaning, risking concepts being too rushed for full comprehension if not perfectly synchronized with visuals.",
      "Ensuring the 'Family Guy' comedic tone is consistently applied across all mathematical explanations without trivializing the concepts or losing the educational element requires careful scriptwriting and visual execution.  Humor that relies on rapid visual gags must be precisely timed.",
      "The sheer density of concepts (domain/range, one-to-one, onto, bijections, composition, even/odd, periodic) poses a significant risk of overwhelming the viewer or rushing the explanations to the point of incomprehensibility, especially within the tight 35-second Instagram constraint.  Balancing humor with accurate, albeit simplified, mathematical representation will be the primary technical challenge."

      "Visual metaphors like mirror symmetry for even functions and rotational symmetry for odd functions need to be extremely quick and clear. Perhaps the dragon briefly splits into two identical halves (mirror) or spins into a recognizable pattern (rotational).",
      "For one-to-one, onto, and bijections, visually show the dragon transforming into distinct forms (one-to-one), ensuring all possible forms are reachable (onto), and then a perfect, reversible mapping (bijection). The speed of these transitions is key, with the dragon delivering a quick one-liner.",

      "Even/odd functions can be shown with symmetry. The dragon transforming into a mirrored image (even) or a rotational equivalent (odd), with the 'territory map' visually reflecting this symmetry.",
      "Periodic functions could be demonstrated by the dragon repeatedly transforming into the same sequence of forms, perhaps stuck in a loop. The 'territory map' could show a repeating pattern.",
      "For function composition, show the dragon going through the 'transformation machine' twice with different functions, resulting in a new, possibly unexpected, transformation.",
      "Prioritize 'transformation machine' gags for the bulk of the concepts: inputting a 'domain' object, the machine attempts to produce an 'output' (function rule), with a comedic failure showing what's outside the domain, or a success showing a correct transformation. This covers transformation rules and domain/range efficiently.",

    "The key to success on Instagram with this complex topic and short duration is to ensure that every second is packed with visual humor directly linked to the mathematical concept.  The visual metaphors are our primary tools for making abstract ideas instantly understandable and entertaining, thus driving engagement.",
