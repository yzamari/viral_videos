[VISUAL: Epic animated title card: "EPISODE 6: Power-Up Dragon Mathematics!!" with crackling energy and dragon roars.] DIALOGUE: Welcome, young dragons, to the power-up workshop! [VISUAL: Baby dragon in a workshop, using tools on a glowing 'power crystal' representing a fractional exponent.] DIALOGUE: Fractional powers are like magic roots, turning power into smaller, tastier flames. [VISUAL: More dragons appearing, forming a shimmering cloud around the baby dragon. Numbers flow like energy streams.] DIALOGUE: Real exponents are infinite dragon gatherings, limits shaping their true power. [VISUAL: Dragons separating into distinct 'bubble zones', some with isolated points.] DIALOGUE: Topology is about dragon shapes and connections, not just counting fireballs. [VISUAL: The Cantor set appears as a shimmering, infinitely detailed fractal magic pattern made of dragon dust.] DIALOGUE: Even these intricate fractal magic patterns have special dragon math secrets!
