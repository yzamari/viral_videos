# Viral AI Video Generation Platform - Integration Tests Summary

This document provides a summary of the integration tests for the Viral AI Video Generation Platform.

## Overview

The integration tests are located in the `tests/integration/` directory. They are designed to test the interaction between different components of the system, such as the agents, generators, and services.

## Test Suites

The integration tests are organized into the following suites:

*   `test_enterprise_system.py`: Tests the full enterprise system, including the interaction between all agents and services.
*   `test_real_video_generation.py`: Tests the video generation process using real AI models and services.
*   `test_video_generation.py`: Tests the video generation process using mock AI models and services.

## Running the Tests

The integration tests can be run using the following command:

```
pytest tests/integration/
```

## Coverage

The integration tests cover the following key areas of the system:

*   **Video Generation**: The tests ensure that the video generation pipeline is working correctly, from script generation to final video assembly.
*   **Agent Interaction**: The tests ensure that the agents are interacting with each other correctly and that data is being passed between them as expected.
*   **Service Integration**: The tests ensure that the platform is integrating correctly with external AI models and services.
*   **Error Handling**: The tests ensure that the platform is handling errors gracefully and that the fallback mechanisms are working as expected.
