1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,684
The throne awaits;

2
00:00:00,684 --> 00:00:01,368
Peres finally sits.

3
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:02,616
But the 'Acting PM' title mocks

4
00:00:02,616 --> 00:00:04,296
his every move.

5
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,976
He reaches for

6
00:00:05,976 --> 00:00:10,224
the gavel, a weighty symbol of

7
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:14,088
power, strain etched deep on his

8
00:00:14,088 --> 00:00:14,248
face.

9
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:15,048
Operation Grapes erupts, a nightmare

10
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,788
of missiles raining down uncontrollably.

11
00:00:17,788 --> 00:00:18,336
What

12
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:19,044
have I done?

13
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:19,752
The Qana disaster

14
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:20,664
unfolds, a catastrophic accident.

15
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:21,120
Horror grips

16
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,711
the nation.

17
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:22,896
The election battle rages;

18
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:24,064
Bibi and Peres clash.

19
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,647
A razor-thin

20
00:00:24,647 --> 00:00:25,864
margin of one percent!

21
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:26,472
An agonizingly

22
00:00:26,472 --> 00:00:27,208
close defeat.

23
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,679
Always the bridesmaid, never

24
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,000
the bride.

25
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,160
Mr.

26
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,640
Peace becomes President

27
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,320
ofâ€¦ nothing at all.

28
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,160
At ninety-three,

29
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,856
his dreams dim, a legacy unfulfilled.
