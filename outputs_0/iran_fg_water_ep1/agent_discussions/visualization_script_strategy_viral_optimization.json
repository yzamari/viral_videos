The strategy hinges on leveraging Family Guy's signature exaggerated animation and rapid cuts to deliver sharp, dark humor that highlights water scarcity. This approach will maximize engagement by immediately grabbing attention with the familiar animation style and then using a progression of absurd, relatable scenarios to convey the message effectively and memorably.",

The core strategy is to mirror the show's comedic timing with quick cuts and exaggerated reactions, making the dark humor about water's 'ghosting' and the citizens' plight both memorable and impactful within the 60-second window.",

The strategy focuses on punchy dialogue, exaggerated animation of Maryam and the fleeing water droplets, a dismissive government official, and starkly dark humor of citizens licking dew, all precisely timed to a sharp cut to black after the Persian subtitle.",
