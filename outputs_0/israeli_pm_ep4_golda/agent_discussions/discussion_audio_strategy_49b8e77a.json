This will allow for visual storytelling, sound design, and brief dialogue delivery, fitting within the target duration with ~8 segments., Employ a distinct, powerful sound effect for each 'POW!', 'KABOOM!', and 'SNAP!' to emphasize the action and comic-book feel. For 'TIME REWIND PANELS', a subtle tape rewind sound will be crucial for clarity. The 'Internet EXPLODES' should be a cacophony of digital sounds and notification pings. For the 'intelligence failure', a sharp sound of scattering papers and a distorted 'error' tone will be effective., Allocate approximately 4-6 seconds per major narrative beat (e.g., 'SMOKE PANEL', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'YOM KIPPUR WAR', 'Kitchen Diplomacy', 'Resignation', 'Final Panel').
