00:00.000 --> 00:00.202
Surprise!

00:00.202 --> 00:01.008
A Prime Minister's panel

00:01.008 --> 00:01.435
convened.

00:01.435 --> 00:03.144
Olmert declared, "I did

00:03.144 --> 00:04.776
not ask for this!

00:04.776 --> 00:05.592
" It

00:05.592 --> 00:08.280
felt like a sudden, venomous

00:08.280 --> 00:09.538
spider bite.

00:09.538 --> 00:11.424
The Lebanon War

00:11.424 --> 00:12.442
spawned two investigative panels;

00:12.442 --> 00:12.696
an

00:12.696 --> 00:13.550
immediate attack.

00:13.550 --> 00:14.832
Everything crumbled spectacularly.

00:14.832 --> 00:18.720
The Winograd investigation resembled a

00:18.720 --> 00:20.174
relentless SHIELD interrogation.

00:20.174 --> 00:21.144
Secret negotiations

00:21.144 --> 00:22.200
offered Jerusalem.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.784
They even suggested,

00:23.784 --> 00:25.304
"Take the Infinity Gauntlet!

00:25.304 --> 00:26.064
" Imagine

00:26.064 --> 00:28.944
wielding that immense power.

00:28.944 --> 00:29.664
Corruption

00:29.664 --> 00:33.408
panels revealed a Hydra-like proliferation

00:33.408 --> 00:34.080
of wrongdoing.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.088
Cash envelopes rained

00:35.088 --> 00:39.072
down, a torrential storm of

00:39.072 --> 00:39.533
illicit funds.

00:39.533 --> 00:40.224
Then came the

00:40.224 --> 00:41.002
prison sentence.

00:41.002 --> 00:42.168
The removal of

00:42.168 --> 00:43.800
his power, like stripping Iron

00:43.800 --> 00:46.464
Man of his armor, began

00:46.464 --> 00:47.875
with a clang.

00:47.875 --> 00:48.816
Prison stripes.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.016
The first Prime Minister imprisoned.

00:50.016 --> 00:50.327
A hollow cell echo resonated.

00:50.327 --> 00:50.700
He reflected, "I almost achieved peace.

00:50.700 --> 00:51.073
" A memoir's poignant thought bubble:

00:51.073 --> 00:51.322
"If only they knew...

00:51.322 --> 00:51.384
"
