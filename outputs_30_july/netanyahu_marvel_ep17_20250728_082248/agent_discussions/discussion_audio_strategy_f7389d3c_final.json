    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Assign a unique, punchy sound effect for every distinct action described: 'CRASH!' for the wall, 'WHOOSH!' for smoke, 'BOOM!' for exploding panels, 'ZAP!' for texting, 'THWACK!' for energy beams, 'CRACK!' for national division, and a powerful 'WHAM!' with electrical crackling for the flag. Ensure these are layered and mixed to create a chaotic yet cohesive sonic experience., The voiceover for 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' needs to be delivered with a dramatic, slightly over-the-top tone, reminiscent of a comic book narrator or villain. Consider adding a subtle reverb or echo to emphasize its power. Timing is critical; these lines must align perfectly with the peak of their respective visual moments to maximize impact., Allocate 1-2 seconds for each distinct action and sound effect combination to ensure clarity and impact within the 35-second window, e.g., Knesset crash + 'CRASH!' + 'I am eternal!' in 3-4 seconds.",
