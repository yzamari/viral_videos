  "mission": "Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon conductor runs a magical number train to teach sequences and limits. Each train car represents sequence terms approaching a limit. Explain convergence, epsilon-delta definition, unique limit theorem, bounded sequences, arithmetic of limits, and the squeeze theorem. Use visual metaphors: train approaching limit station, epsilon tunnels, safety rails for bounds. Make it entertaining while teaching how sequences converge to limits with mathematical precision.",

    "original_script": "Welcome aboard the Number Train! Our baby dragon conductor guides us toward a special station. Each car, a sequence number, gets closer and closer. This is convergence! See the tiny epsilon tunnels? They show how numbers stay near the limit. Bounds keep our train on track, always within limits. No derailing! With these math lessons, sequences and limits are now super clear!",
    "final_script": "Welcome aboard the Number Train. Our baby dragon conductor leads us to a special station. Each train car shows a sequence number, getting closer. This demonstrates convergence. See the tiny epsilon tunnels? They illustrate how numbers approach the limit. Bounds keep our train on track, within limits. No derailing is allowed. These math lessons make sequences and limits clear. We have learned about sequences and their limits",
