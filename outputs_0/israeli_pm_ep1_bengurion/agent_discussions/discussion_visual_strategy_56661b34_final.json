    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate a strict 6-8 seconds per major action panel (e.g., desert emergence, independence declaration), ensuring each beat is visually distinct and narratively potent, punctuated by the requested 'BOOM!', 'SNAP!', 'KA-POW!' sound effects to maintain a rapid, engaging pace., Utilize animated comic book elements like 'Kirby Dots energy' for the kibbutz building segment and dynamic motion lines for the yoga headstand to visually bridge scenes and convey action without lengthy dialogue, maximizing the impact of each panel., Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds per major action panel (e.g., 'BOOM! Ben-Gurion bursts from desert sands,' 'SNAP! British Mandate vanishes') with corresponding 'POW!'/'WHAM!' style sound effects and bold on-screen text for dialogue like 'I am... INEVITABLE!'.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting all the detailed narrative elements, including the plot twist and editor's note, into the 65-second window without sacrificing the intended dramatic pacing or visual clarity. Each panel's audio and visual cues must be concise and potent.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the described elements into the 65-second window without the pacing feeling *too* frantic, which could lead to viewer fatigue or a loss of clarity. Each panel's visual and auditory cues need to be impactful yet brief.",

      "The primary concern is the sheer density of distinct narrative beats within the 65-second timeframe. Each panel requires careful timing to ensure visual clarity and emotional resonance without feeling rushed, especially on a platform like Instagram where immediate engagement is key."

We'll use distinct, impactful sound design for each 'BOOM!', 'SNAP!', 'KA-POW!', and 'WHOOSH!'."
