The \"HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD\" should immediately establish the comedic tone and epic scope. Focus on visually dynamic explanations of exponents and topology, keeping the pacing brisk to hold attention across the 'unknown duration'.",

Visual metaphors like 'power transformations' for exponents and 'bubble zones' for open sets will be key for Instagram's short attention spans. The Cantor set can be visualized as 'fractal magic' with infinitely dividing dragon scales, creating shareable, mind-bending moments.",
