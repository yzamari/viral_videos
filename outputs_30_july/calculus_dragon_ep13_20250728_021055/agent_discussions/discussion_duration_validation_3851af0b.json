        "Visual gag idea: 'Critical points' are potential suspects, identified by the dragon's 'first derivative breath' that causes them to visibly shake (indicating a change in direction/slope). Second derivative tests could be the detective's 'mood swing meter,' showing if the function's behavior is speeding up or slowing down its change."
