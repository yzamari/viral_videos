1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,996
Alright, Stewie, we are finding treasure
on this map section!

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:09,207
The Extreme Value Theorem indicates the
best and worst loot

3
00:00:09,507 --> 00:00:11,372
is at the edges or peaks.

4
00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:12,616
This dragon's velocity is

5
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:13,240
uniformly continuous;

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:13,888
it will not teleport.

7
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:14,535
Derivatives represent dragon velocity;

8
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:16,774
they show our speed at any point.

9
00:00:16,774 --> 00:00:17,604
If a function

10
00:00:17,904 --> 00:00:20,099
is differentiable, it is continuous,
unlike this bumpy dragon ride.

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,440
We must use this to our advantage during
this treasure

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,033
hunt.

13
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:28,666
The map shows a clear path, let us
follow

14
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:29,677
it carefully.

15
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:32,163
Remember, Stewie, patience is key to
success.

16
00:00:32,163 --> 00:00:32,519
We

17
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:35,196
do not want to anger the dragon.

18
00:00:35,196 --> 00:00:36,215
This treasure is

19
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:36,787
worth the effort.

20
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:37,422
Our success depends on precision and
timing.

21
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:37,785
Are you ready, Stewie?

22
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:38,239
Let us proceed with caution
