'Montserrat-Bold' offers a clean, modern feel that aligns with Instagram aesthetics while being highly readable. The vibrant magenta primary color paired with a stark black stroke and shadow creates high contrast, essential for attention-grabbing CTAs. The semi-transparent white background ensures it stands out against diverse video content without being opaque. The 'pulse' animation adds dynamic movement, encouraging viewers to take action. 'Words per line' are kept low for quick comprehension in a scroll-heavy environment.", "color_psychology": "The primary color, magenta (#FF00A8), is chosen for its association with fun, viral, and trendy content, aligning perfectly with the goal of driving follows on a platform like Instagram. The high contrast with the black stroke and shadow ensures WCAG AAA compliance (contrast ratio > 7:1), making it accessible to a wide audience. The neutral white background, with reduced opacity, prevents it from overpowering the video content while still maintaining visibility."}}
