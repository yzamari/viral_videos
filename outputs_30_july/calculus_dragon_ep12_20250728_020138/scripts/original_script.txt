[VISUAL: A shimmering crystal ball showing a blurry, wavering image.] DIALOGUE: Behold, young one, the blurry future of this function! [VISUAL: The crystal ball image sharpens slightly, revealing a straight line.] DIALOGUE: We approximate it with a simple line, like a predictable prediction. [VISUAL: A second, more intricate line appears over the first, refining the prediction.] DIALOGUE: Then, a touch more magic, a quadratic curve, bringing clarity closer. [VISUAL: The error between the crystal ball and the approximation shrinks visibly.] DIALOGUE: Each term, a shrinking error, a purer glimpse of truth revealed. [VISUAL: The crystal ball displays a complex, beautiful fractal pattern.] DIALOGUE: Infinite terms, a perfect prediction, the true infinite magic of series unfolds.
