    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Segment 1 (Surprise PM Panel): Use a sudden, sharp sound like a comic book 'POW!' or 'SURPRISE!' effect followed by Olmert's line with a slightly amplified, stressed vocal delivery and a subtle, unsettling 'spider-bite' sting., Segment 2 (Lebanon War 2): Implement rapid-fire, escalating sound effects. Start with a military-style launch sound, then layer in 'BOOM!' and 'CRASH!' for the failures, ensuring audio intensity rises with the description., Segment 3 (Winograd Investigation): Employ a suspenseful, echoing soundscape reminiscent of intense interrogation scenes. Consider a 'SHIELD-style' subtle electronic hum or a rapid, rhythmic click track for the interrogation panels.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is ensuring the narrative remains clear and impactful across the 8 segments within the tight timeframe, especially with the high density of events and visual gags described.",
      "Ensuring that the sound design genuinely enhances the narrative and doesn't just add noise is critical. Each effect must serve the storytelling purpose.",
      "Maintaining audio quality across a variety of sound effects and voiceovers on Instagram can be challenging; clear mixing is essential.",
      "The primary concern is maintaining narrative clarity and impact across numerous rapid shifts in plot and tone within the tight 65-second timeframe. Overcrowding segments with too much dialogue or too many visual elements could lead to viewer confusion or disengagement.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all these distinct visual and audio cues into the ~65-second target duration without feeling rushed or losing clarity. Each segment needs to be very short and impactful."

      "Segment 2 (Lebanon War 2): Implement rapid-fire, escalating sound effects. Start with a military-style launch sound, then layer in 'BOOM!' and 'CRASH!' for the failures, ensuring audio intensity rises with the description.",
      "Segment 1 (Surprise PM Panel): Use a sudden, sharp sound like a comic book 'POW!' or 'SURPRISE!' effect followed by Olmert's line with a slightly amplified, stressed vocal delivery and a subtle, unsettling 'spider-bite' sting.",
      "Utilize distinct visual styles for each 'panel' \u2013 think bold graphic overlays, comic book sound effect text (BOOM, CRASH), and sharp transitions to mimic panel flips.",
      "Segment each core event (e.g., 'Spider-bite style', 'LAUNCHING ATTACK!', 'SHIELD-style interrogation') into distinct, brief visual panels (2-3 seconds each), with sharp cuts and impactful sound effects (e.g., 'BOOM!', 'CRASH!', 'CLANK!').",
      "Segment 4 (Secret Talks): Create an almost surreal soundscape with a hint of dramatic tension, possibly incorporating a subtle sound effect for 'Jerusalem offers' and a grand, yet ominous, flourish for 'INFINITY GAUNTLET'.",
      "Utilize visual metaphors like the 'Infinity Gauntlet' and 'Hydra heads' with strong, illustrative graphics to quickly convey complex ideas, reinforcing the comic book theme and aiding comprehension for quick viewing.",
      "Segment 8 (Memoir/Thought Bubble): End with a soft, fading ambient sound, possibly a gentle sigh or a quiet, melancholic piano note, to underscore the 'despair' and 'if only they knew' sentiment.",
      "The 'SHIELD-style interrogation' and 'Iron Man armor removal' sequences are prime opportunities for impactful visual effects and precise sound editing to nail the 'CLANK!' and the finality.",
      "Segment 7 (Prison Stripes/Cell Echo): A hollow, reverberating sound for the cell. Olmert's line 'I almost made PEACE!' should have a melancholic echo effect, creating a sense of isolation.",
      "Segment 5 (Corruption): Use a rapid, almost overwhelming sequence of cash register 'cha-chings' and a multiplying 'Hydra head' sound effect, perhaps a subtle growing hiss, for the corruption panels.",
      "Segment 3 (Winograd Investigation): Employ a suspenseful, echoing soundscape reminiscent of intense interrogation scenes. Consider a 'SHIELD-style' subtle electronic hum or a rapid, rhythmic click track for the interrogation panels.",
      "Segment 6 (Prison Fitting): The 'Iron Man armor REMOVAL' needs a distinct 'CLANK!' sound, followed by a metallic peeling or whirring, then silence for the transition to prison stripes."
