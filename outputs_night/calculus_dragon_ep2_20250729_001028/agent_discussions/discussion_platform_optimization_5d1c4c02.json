The visual representations of mathematical concepts, like the merging parallel tracks for the Squeeze Theorem, need to be incredibly clear and impactful, even on a small screen, to maximize click-through and watch time. We need to ensure the jokes and explanations are integrated seamlessly with these visuals to create an unforgettable, shareable educational experience.",

Focusing on the initial 3-second title card's epic effect and the visual clarity of mathematical analogies for 'Sequence Dragon Express' directly addresses the platform's need for immediate engagement and shareability.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Design the 3-second title card with bold, contrasting colors and dynamic dragon animations that scream 'epic' and hint at comedy, potentially featuring the 'Sequence Dragon Express' text in a stylized, train-track font. Use eye-catching transitions to instantly hook viewers, leading directly into the core math-as-train analogy.",
        "Ensure each mathematical concept (convergence, Squeeze Theorem, bounded sequences) has a distinct, visually memorable train analogy that's easily understood with minimal text. For instance, the 'limit station' could be a brightly lit, desirable destination, with cars (terms) jockeying to get closer, and Epsilon/Delta as friendly, perhaps slightly quirky, border guards ensuring smooth passage."
