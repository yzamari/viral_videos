The 40-second format demands hyper-efficient pacing, dedicating approximately 5-7 seconds per mathematical point.",

The visual progression from a fuzzy to a sharp prediction in the crystal ball is key to illustrating increasing precision and shrinking errors.",

          "message": "For \"EPISODE 12: Dragon's Crystal Ball!!\", the audio strategy must prioritize comedic timing with the Family Guy style. Each mathematical concept needs a distinct sound effect or vocal inflection from the dragon to highlight its 'magical' explanation and the shrinking error metaphor. The 3-second title card demands an epic, attention-grabbing soundscape that immediately sets the humorous and educational tone, perfectly synchronizing with the visual explosion.",
