    "reasoning": "A 'Family Guy' style implies a distinct cartoon aesthetic with bold lines and exaggerated features, which is highly suitable for Instagram. Vibrant colors will grab attention and make the educational content more engaging for a general audience. This style allows for the creative visual metaphors (dragon transformation machine, territory maps, symmetry) to be easily depicted and understood. A cartoon style also aligns well with the platform's preference for creative and animated content, leading to higher engagement.",

    "reasoning": "For Instagram, avoiding the bottom 20% is key. 'bottom_center' provides good visibility without encroaching on the main content area or crucial UI elements. A static position is appropriate for overlay text that needs to be consistently readable.",
