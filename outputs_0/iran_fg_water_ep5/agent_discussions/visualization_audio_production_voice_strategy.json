Exaggerated sound effects for the warrior fight and the water truck impact, alongside distinct voice acting, are crucial for comedic payoff within the tight 60-second window.",

The voice acting needs to capture the essence of Peter and Brian with exaggerated delivery, while Maryam's dialogue should convey escalating desperation, culminating in a darkly comedic release. The sound design will be key for impactful cuts and the final ironic message.",
