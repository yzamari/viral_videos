  "mission": "EPISODE 4: Dragon Stairs & Time Loops!! Show this as HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects! Family Guy time-travel comedy! Dragon discovers a MATHEMATICAL TIME MACHINE powered by the number e! Each recursive step takes him through mathematical history, meeting famous mathematicians. Monotonic sequences are elevator operators, Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem is a helpful time guide, and nested intervals are time portals. Dragon hilariously explains each concept while time-traveling. Include funny historical encounters, dragon's time-travel jokes, and visual demonstrations of recursive concepts!",

[VISUAL: Dragon excitedly pointing at a complex mathematical device humming with energy, powered by 'e'.] DIALOGUE: My mathematical time machine, powered by 'e', is ready! Let us witness history unfold recursively. [VISUAL: Dragon meeting Archimedes, who is using monotonic sequences as elevator operators, then encountering Gauss.] DIALOGUE: Monotonic sequences are just upwardly mobile operators! And nested intervals are my personal time portals! [VISUAL: Dragon giving a thumbs-up while a visual of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem is shown as a helpful guide.]",
    "final_script": "Prepare for a hilariously epic, Family Guy-style time-travel adventure! My mathematical time machine is ready. Let us witness history unfold. Monotonic sequences are simply upwardly mobile operators. Nested intervals are my personal time portals. We will explore paradoxes and possibilities. Time itself bends to my will. This journey will be unforgettable. Expect the unexpected. Prepare to laugh. Prepare to be amazed. The adventure begins now",
