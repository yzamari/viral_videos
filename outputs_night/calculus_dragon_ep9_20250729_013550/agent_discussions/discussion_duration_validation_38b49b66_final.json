    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Ensure the 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD' establishes the comedic tone and epic feel immediately, ideally incorporating sound effects that match the 'Family Guy' style for maximum impact within its 3-second duration., Craft short, sharp dialogue segments (1-2 sentences, ~10-15 words per sentence) that clearly link the treasure hunting actions to the mathematical concepts, using visual cues for each segment to reinforce learning., For the 'unknown duration', aim for a tight narrative that can easily be trimmed or slightly expanded. Prioritize the core explanations of Extreme Value Theorem, uniform continuity, and derivatives, ensuring a clear audio-visual sync throughout.",

      "Ensuring the visual metaphors are universally understood and directly correlate to the mathematical principles is crucial for effective communication.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the specified mathematical concepts (Extreme Value Theorem, uniform continuity, derivatives, max/min on closed intervals, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor theorem, instantaneous rate of change, differentiability/continuity relationship) into a potentially short, engaging Instagram video without overwhelming the audience.",
      "Ensuring the visual metaphors are universally understandable and directly map to the abstract mathematical ideas could be challenging.  The Heine-Cantor theorem and monotonic bijections might be particularly difficult to visualize succinctly within the narrative.",
      "Balancing the 'Family Guy style comedy' with the educational rigor of these advanced calculus concepts can be challenging; the humor must serve the learning without undermining it.",
      "The primary concern is cramming all the specified mathematical concepts (Extreme Value Theorem, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor, derivatives, differentiability/continuity relationship) into a 40-second format without sacrificing comedic timing or clarity, especially on Instagram where attention spans are short.  Balancing the humor with accurate mathematical explanation is a delicate act.",
      "The primary concern is cramming all the specified mathematical concepts (Extreme Value Theorem, uniform continuity, Heine-Cantor, derivatives, differentiability/continuity relationship) into a digestible format for Instagram, especially with the comedic elements. Each segment needs to be extremely concise to avoid losing the audience."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Allocate 3 seconds for the animated title card, then dedicate approximately 7-8 seconds per core concept (Extreme Value Theorem, Uniform Continuity, Derivatives) to fit the 40-second target, ensuring smooth transitions using the treasure hunting narrative.",
      "Allocate approximately 5-7 seconds for the animated title card to set the tone. Then, break down each concept into very short segments (e.g., 3-5 seconds each) with clear visual cues, like a dragon's flight path for velocity or measuring the slope of a treasure map for derivatives, to keep viewers hooked.",
      "Visualize the 'dragon velocity' as the derivative, with the treasure hunter measuring the slope of the dragon's flight path as it ascends or descends to find maximum and minimum altitudes on a closed interval (e.g., between two mountain peaks).",
      "Visually represent the 'derivative as instantaneous rate of change' by showing the dragon's speed at a specific point on its treasure-hunting path, perhaps using a speedometer or a dynamic graph overlay.",
      "Ensure the 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD' establishes the comedic tone and epic feel immediately, ideally incorporating sound effects that match the 'Family Guy' style for maximum impact within its 3-second duration.",
      "The relationship between differentiability and continuity can be shown by a dragon smoothly flying over an unbroken treasure map (continuous) versus a dragon encountering a sudden chasm or missing piece (discontinuous/not differentiable).",
      "Craft short, sharp dialogue segments (1-2 sentences, ~10-15 words per sentence) that clearly link the treasure hunting actions to the mathematical concepts, using visual cues for each segment to reinforce learning.",
      "For the Heine-Cantor theorem and monotonic bijections, use visual metaphors like a consistently increasing treasure hoard's value or a predictable treasure-finding path to illustrate these concepts.",
      "For the 'unknown duration', aim for a tight narrative that can easily be trimmed or slightly expanded. Prioritize the core explanations of Extreme Value Theorem, uniform continuity, and derivatives, ensuring a clear audio-visual sync throughout.",
      "Develop distinct visual metaphors for each theorem. For the Extreme Value Theorem, perhaps a dragon finding the highest and lowest points of a mountain range. For uniform continuity, show a treasure map that doesn't change significantly when zoomed in slightly, ensuring consistent detail across the interval."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To maximize engagement for this topic on Instagram, the core focus should be on punchy, visually driven explanations using the treasure hunting and dragon metaphors.  The Family Guy style comedy needs to be integrated seamlessly with the educational content, ensuring the humor enhances, rather than detracts from, the understanding of the mathematical concepts.",
      "For Episode 9, the key is to maintain the comedic momentum of the Family Guy style while ensuring the mathematical concepts are crystal clear, using the treasure hunt and dragon visuals as anchors. We need tight pacing to deliver complex ideas efficiently on Instagram.",
      "For Episode 9, we must synchronize the comedic Family Guy style with the educational content by ensuring the treasure hunting and dragon metaphors visually represent the mathematical concepts clearly. This requires tightly integrated visuals and dialogue to maintain engagement within the target duration, maximizing clarity on Instagram."
