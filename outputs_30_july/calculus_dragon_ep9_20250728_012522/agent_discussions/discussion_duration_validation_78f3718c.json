Then, dedicate 4-5 seconds per concept (Extreme Value Theorem, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor, derivatives as rate of change) with corresponding visual metaphors. Ensure the relationship between differentiability and continuity is visually demonstrated in the final 5-7 seconds.",

The 'monotonic bijection' can be visualized as a treasure map that always leads to a unique, progressively more valuable spot, and 'Heine-Cantor' by showing a treasure chest that consistently reveals a predictable amount of gold regardless of where the dragon opens it."
