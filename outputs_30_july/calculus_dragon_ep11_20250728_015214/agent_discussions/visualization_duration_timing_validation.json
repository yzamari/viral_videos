Each calculus concept needs a distinct 'ultimate technique' visual, like a dragon performing a 'Darboux Double Derivative' move. This visual storytelling is key to making the educational content digestible and hilarious within Instagram's fast-paced environment.",

The pacing must ensure that the visual gag and the core concept are delivered within segments that allow for rapid succession, keeping engagement high within the 35-second target.",
