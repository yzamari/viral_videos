We need to leverage distinct, over-the-top comic book sound effects that punctuate each action, ensuring they are precisely timed to land within the 35-second window for maximum engagement on Instagram.",

Each sound effect \u2013 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!' \u2013 must feel like a comic panel transition, emphasizing the over-the-top, high-energy nature for maximum Instagram impact.",

Each sound effect, particularly the onomatopoeia like 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', and 'BOOM!', needs to be sharp, layered, and precisely timed to the visual cues to maintain the rapid-fire, comic-book pacing essential for Instagram engagement within the 35-second window.",
