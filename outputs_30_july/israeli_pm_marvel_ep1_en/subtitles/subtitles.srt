00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,758
From the sands, a titan emerges.

2
00:00:01,758 --> 00:00:02,638
I am inevitable,

3
00:00:02,938 --> 00:00:04,665
he declares with mighty power.

4
00:00:04,665 --> 00:00:06,046
With a snap, the

5
00:00:06,346 --> 00:00:10,317

energy.

00:00:25,963 --> 00:00:27,519
vision and revolutionary spirit.

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,463
The sands whisper his name,

14
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,188
a legend etched in time.

15
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:32,898
His impact resonates, echoing through
generations
