Dressed as woman in operation flashback - 'I understood gender fluidity before it was cool.' Coalition crumbles faster than Thanos snap. Loses to Sharon in biggest landslide ever. Later: Epstein's island cameo, 'I kept my underwear on!' Apartment in luxury tower: 'I'm watching you... from above.'",
