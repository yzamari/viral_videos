Functions are like transformation machines. Input a roar, output a chair. The domain includes all possible inputs. The range is only the outputs created. One-to-one functions have one input for each output. Onto functions use all possible outputs; there are no leftovers. Bijections are perfect one-to-one and onto transformations. Function composition chains transformations together. Even functions are symmetrical; odd functions are rotationally symmetrical. Some functions repeat their output, like a broken record
