  "script_content": "Alright, Stewie, buckle up. We are learning about limits, dragon-style. Limits are like a smooth flight, not that teleporting nonsense. We approach our destination smoothly. A perfect landing is continuity; from any direction, we arrive smoothly. Epsilon-delta means getting our flight path very close to the target altitude. One-sided limits are like approaching a landing strip from the left or the right. A sudden jump indicates a discontinuity. No teleporting is allowed mid-flight. Continuity means our flight is a single, unbroken path. The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees we can fly to any altitude between two points",
