The dark humor will stem from juxtaposing Ben-Gurion's immense historical impact with a modern, slightly jaded superhero trope.",

          "message": "For a 35-second Instagram intro of Ben-Gurion as a Marvel-style hero with dark humor, we must prioritize dynamic visual storytelling. This means rapid cuts between historical footage treated with comic-book effects (think 'POW!' text overlays, bold outlines, and desaturated comic palette) and modern stylized graphics. The voiceover should be our primary driver of the dark humor, delivering lines with a deep, slightly weary gravitas, as if he's the reluctant hero of a world he barely understands.",
