00:00.000 --> 00:03.161
Welcome to synchronized swimming, Cauchy
Dragons!

00:03.461 --> 00:05.969
Maintain epsilon distance, team.

00:06.269 --> 00:09.168
The Heine-Borel theorem ensures our
boundaries.

00:09.468 --> 00:11.819
Dedekind cuts guide our dives.

00:12.119 --> 00:13.922
Precision is paramount;

00:14.222 --> 00:16.285
consequences await errors.

00:16.585 --> 00:18.388
Completeness is essential.

00:18.688 --> 00:21.352
Each movement must refine our performance.

00:21.652 --> 00:23.716
This is mathematical teamwork;

00:24.016 --> 00:25.322
we are united.

00:25.622 --> 00:27.921
Our synchronicity is our strength.

00:28.221 --> 00:30.624
We strive for flawless execution.

00:30.924 --> 00:33.798
Success depends on our collective
precision.

00:34.098 --> 00:36.527
We will achieve perfection together.

00:36.827 --> 00:38.786
Our unity is our power.

00:39.086 --> 00:42.247
This performance is a testament to our
collaboration.

00:42.547 --> 00:44.323
We are the Cauchy Dragons
