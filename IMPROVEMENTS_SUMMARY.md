# Viral Video Generator - Improvements Summary

## 🎯 All Issues Fixed & Improvements Implemented

### ✅ 1. Configurable Video Duration
- **Issue**: Video length was hardcoded at 10 seconds
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `VIDEO_DURATION` environment variable (default: 30 seconds)
  - Updated `config.py` to read from environment
  - Modified all video generation functions to use configurable duration
  - Scene durations automatically adjust based on total video length

**Usage:**
```bash
# Set custom duration
export VIDEO_DURATION=15  # 15-second videos
export VIDEO_DURATION=60  # 1-minute videos

# Or in .env file
VIDEO_DURATION=45
```
