    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Utilize split-screen or rapid cuts to contrast 'smooth' (continuous) flight with 'teleporting' (discontinuous) flight for clear visual metaphors of limits and continuity., Incorporate exaggerated character reactions and sound effects, typical of Family Guy, to punctuate key mathematical explanations and enhance comedic timing., Dedicate significant visual screen time to the 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD' with epic effects, establishing the high-energy, comedic tone immediately within the first 3 seconds.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is balancing the comedic Family Guy style with the accurate, yet simplified, explanation of advanced calculus concepts like the Cauchy criterion. Overemphasis on comedy could dilute the educational value, while too much math could alienate the general audience.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the complexity of mathematical concepts like the Cauchy criterion with the brevity and comedic demands of the Family Guy style and Instagram format. Over-explaining could alienate the audience.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the educational depth of the mathematical concepts with the comedic and fast-paced nature of Instagram content, ensuring neither aspect overwhelms the other.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the educational aspect with the comedy. If the math becomes too dense or the humor too niche, it could alienate the general audience and reduce engagement."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Utilize rapid-fire scene changes and absurd scenarios for discontinuities. A 'jump discontinuity' could be the dragon suddenly teleporting to a different altitude without a smooth transition, bewildering the pilot.",
      "When explaining the epsilon-delta definition, show the dragon pilot making increasingly tiny, precise adjustments to its flight path to meet a specific target altitude (epsilon) within a certain horizontal distance (delta), contrasted with another dragon just 'teleporting' there, highlighting the difference in approach.",
      "Develop quick, punchy visual gags for each math concept. For epsilon-delta, the dragon could try to 'land' within a tiny, specific zone, always 'missing' by a hair, with the pilot exclaiming, 'Almost there, you little speck!'",
      "For the animated title card, ensure it's visually stunning and immediately sets the Family Guy comedic tone, perhaps with a character's unexpected reaction to the \"Smooth Dragon Flights\" title. Integrate a brief, funny sound effect to enhance its impact.",
      "When explaining epsilon-delta, visualize a dragon trying to hit a precise target altitude and location. 'Epsilon' could be the acceptable landing zone deviation (a small shimmering circle), and 'delta' the dragon's approach speed variation required to stay within it. A 'teleporting' dragon would represent a discontinuity.",
      "Utilize split-screen or rapid cuts to contrast 'smooth' (continuous) flight with 'teleporting' (discontinuous) flight for clear visual metaphors of limits and continuity.",
      "Dedicate significant visual screen time to the 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD' with epic effects, establishing the high-energy, comedic tone immediately within the first 3 seconds.",

    "consensus_points": [
      "To maximize engagement for 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' on Instagram, we must leverage the visual comedy and flight analogies to simplify complex math concepts. The Family Guy style should be evident in character interactions and visual gags, ensuring rapid comprehension of limits and continuity through relatable flying scenarios for broad appeal.",
      "To maximize engagement for 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' on Instagram, the key is to visually translate each mathematical concept into a distinct, comical flight analogy. The Family Guy style needs to be meticulously integrated through character quirks and quick visual gags, ensuring the complex math remains secondary to the entertainment.",
      "To maximize engagement for 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' on Instagram, we must prioritize the comedic delivery of the Family Guy-style dragon pilot teaching math concepts through vivid flight analogies. The core strategy is to make the visual humor and relatable flying scenarios the primary hook, ensuring complex math is digestible and shareable."
