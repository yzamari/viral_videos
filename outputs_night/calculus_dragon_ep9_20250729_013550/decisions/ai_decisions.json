    "reasoning": "Family Guy style comedy, animated title card, and general audience on Instagram all point to a cartoon style. Vibrant colors will enhance the 'epic effects' and visual metaphors like treasure hunting and dragon velocity, making it engaging for a broad audience.  This style allows for the visual humor and exaggerated elements inherent in the Family Guy inspiration.",

To best showcase a large, impactful title card without obscuring important visual elements or being cut off by platform-specific safe zones (especially for Instagram's avoidance of the bottom 20%), the top center is the most suitable position.",

Use visual metaphors: treasure hunting, dragon velocity, measuring slopes. Show relationship between differentiability and continuity.",
