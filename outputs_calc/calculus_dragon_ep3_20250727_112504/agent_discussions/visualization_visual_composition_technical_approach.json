Each mathematical concept will be tied to a fantastical scenario involving the baby dragon and its rocket pack, using concise, relatable language and dynamic visuals that evoke wonder and understanding. This approach prioritizes clarity, memorability, and emotional resonance to make abstract mathematical ideas accessible and exciting for a broad audience, effectively conveying that limits help us understand the infinite.",
