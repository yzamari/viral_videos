    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate approximately 7-8 seconds per distinct narrative 'panel' (emergence, transformation, Yom Kippur War, intelligence failure, time rewind, kitchen diplomacy, resignation, final statement) to ensure all key beats are hit within the 65-second target, with aggressive editing to maintain momentum., Employ a confident, slightly gravelly female voice for Golda's narration, reflecting strength and authority, and ensure all sound effects (KABOOM, SNAP, POW, digital explosion) are crisp, impactful, and perfectly synchronized with their respective visual cues to mimic the comic book aesthetic and heighten the dramatic effect., Voice Style: A deep, resonant, and authoritative female voice actor is crucial for Golda, delivering her lines with conviction and gravitas. For the 'kindergartener' transformation, a playful, high-pitched vocal effect or sound bite will be used. Each sound effect (KABOOM, SNAP, POW, digital explosion) must be sharp, impactful, and perfectly timed to match the visual cuts, creating a visceral comic book feel.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Ensuring the final 'Internet EXPLODES' audio and visual for the 'There's no Palestine' statement delivers maximum impact without consuming too much time is crucial for a powerful conclusion.",
      "The primary concern is maintaining the intricate synchronization between the rapid visual panel changes and the corresponding audio cues within the tight 65-second window, as even minor timing discrepancies can disrupt the narrative flow and impact.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all eight distinct visual/narrative beats into approximately 8 seconds each, requiring extremely tight editing. Balancing the impact of the final 'Internet EXPLODES' with the need to end precisely on time is also a critical challenge.",
      "The primary concern is achieving precise timing for each of the eight described 'panels' (including the initial setup and final statement) to fit within the \u00b15% tolerance of 65 seconds. Overlapping audio or visuals could dilute the impact and cause the video to exceed the duration, compromising the mission's adherence to platform and time constraints. Ensuring the 'Internet EXPLODES' visual and audio for the final panel has enough impact without taking too much time is critical."

Each sound effect (KABOOM, SNAP, POW, digital explosion) must be sharp, impactful, and perfectly timed to match the visual cuts, creating a visceral comic book feel.",
      "Utilize distinct, sharp sound effects (KABOOM, SNAP, POW) to punctuate key moments, mirroring comic book conventions and reinforcing the visual storytelling. The 'Internet EXPLODES' sound for the final panel needs to be particularly resonant. For the 'Kitchen Diplomacy' segment, a sudden, jarring sound of world leaders shrinking can amplify the visual.",
      "Allocate approximately 7-8 seconds per distinct narrative 'panel' (emergence, transformation, Yom Kippur War, intelligence failure, time rewind, kitchen diplomacy, resignation, final statement) to ensure all key beats are hit within the 65-second target, with aggressive editing to maintain momentum.",
      "Audio Approach: Implement a layered audio approach. Golda's primary dialogue will be clear and upfront. Background sounds will enhance each panel: the chaotic din of battle with the clinking of a coffee mug for Yom Kippur, a jarring 'snap' for intelligence failure, and a reversed audio sweep for time rewinds. The final 'Internet EXPLODES' needs a potent, multi-layered sound design, combining a digital cacophony with a bass-heavy boom.",
      "Allocate an average of 8 seconds per segment (65 seconds / 8 segments = 8.125 seconds), allowing for slight variations to accommodate visual transitions and dialogue. For example, the opening panel with Golda's emergence and speech could be 7-8 seconds, while the YOM KIPPUR WAR action panels might be slightly shorter at 6-7 seconds to convey rapid escalation. The 'Intelligence failure' and 'TIME REWIND' panels could be combined or given slightly more breathing room (9-10 seconds) to emphasize the warnings.",
      "Employ a confident, slightly gravelly female voice for Golda's narration, reflecting strength and authority, and ensure all sound effects (KABOOM, SNAP, POW, digital explosion) are crisp, impactful, and perfectly synchronized with their respective visual cues to mimic the comic book aesthetic and heighten the dramatic effect."
