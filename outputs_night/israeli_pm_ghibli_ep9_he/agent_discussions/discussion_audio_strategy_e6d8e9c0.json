      "mission": "Studio Ghibli magic! Benjamin Netanyahu, the political magician, sits in a crystal tower above Jerusalem as spellbooks full of political tactics float around him. With a dark suit shining like magical armor and eagle-sharp eyes, he controls political forces like a king. His voice echoes with his powerful staff as he makes statements that move nations. But beneath the magic, his heart still beats with love for Israel. A typhoon of controversies surrounds him, but he stands firm as a rock against the storm. Epic music of an eternal leader.",

Then, focus on Netanyahu's 'eagle-sharp eyes' with a deep, resonant voiceover about his 'love for Israel'., Use sound design to amplify the 'typhoon of controversies' with swirling wind effects and a slightly more chaotic musical undertone, contrasting with his 'rock-like' stance. The 'powerful staff' should have a subtle echoing effect on his voice., Segment the narrative into 8-10 very short visual beats, each around 6-7 seconds, to maintain momentum and fit the ~64-second target. For example, a quick shot of the crystal tower, then Netanyahu's 'eagle-sharp eyes,' followed by a 'spellbook' opening with political tactics visualized.",
