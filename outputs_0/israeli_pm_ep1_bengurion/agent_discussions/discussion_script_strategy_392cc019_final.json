    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate specific time blocks for each key panel: 6-8 seconds for major actions like Ben-Gurion emerging and the Mandate vanishing, and 3-5 seconds for montage and tech panels to maintain momentum. This precise timing ensures all mission elements fit within 65 seconds while allowing visual impact., Utilize strong, distinct sound effects (BOOM, SNAP, KA-POW, WHOOSH) for each visual transition, synchronizing them perfectly with the action and voiceovers to create an immersive, comic-book experience that drives emotional connection and memorability., Frame the entire narrative around the 'inevitability' of Ben-Gurion's actions and the 'creation of a country' as a heroic feat, playing on the 'True Believer' theme to inspire awe and convey the mission's core message of momentous achievement.",
