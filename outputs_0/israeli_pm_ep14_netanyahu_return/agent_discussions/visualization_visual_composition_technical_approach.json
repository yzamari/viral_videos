The \"TIME LOOP\" and \"Strange-style\" can be achieved with visual warping and rapid cuts, while iconic Marvel sound effects like the \"SNAP!\" and \"CRASH!\" will punctuate key narrative shifts.",

          "message": "For this 'Marvel Comics mega-episode' on Instagram, we need to lean heavily into dynamic visual storytelling that mirrors the high-octane Marvel cinematic universe. Employing rapid, punchy cuts between distinct visual panels, each representing a key event or quote, will be essential to maintain viewer engagement within the 65-second timeframe. The 'Strange-style' time loop and 'Thanos-style' elements provide perfect opportunities for visually jarring transitions and layered audio effects that reinforce the thematic parallels.",

Each 7-8 second segment must have a distinct sonic identity, from the 'SNAP!' to the 'CRASH!', ensuring seamless transitions and maximum engagement within the 65-second limit.",
