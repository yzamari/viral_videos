    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Prioritize a hyper-dynamic sound design: Each listed sound effect ('CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', 'WHAM!') needs to be a distinct, punchy audio event, layered and mixed to feel like it's bursting from the screen, with no room for echo or sustain that would push us over 35 seconds. The 'I am eternal!' dialogue should have a slightly deeper, reverberating tone to emphasize its comic-book villain feel., Implement a rapid-fire visual-audio montage: Each scene (Knesset crash, vanishing opposition, exploding panels, juggling trials, energy beams, flag) should be presented in short, sharp bursts, no more than 2-3 seconds each. The sound effects must hit *exactly* at the visual moment of impact or transformation. For example, the 'CRASH!' must coincide precisely with Netanyahu breaking through the wall. The 'WHOOSH!' needs to occur as the opposition dissolves into smoke. The 'ZAP!' must align with the energy beam. This creates a relentless, engaging pace for Instagram., Layer aggressive, distinct sound effects for each action: 'CRASH!' for the Knesset wall breach, 'WHOOSH!' for vanishing opposition, 'BOOM!' for exploding coalition panels, 'ZAP!' for texting trials, 'THWACK!' for energy beam settlements, 'CRACK!' for the judicial reform split, and 'WHAM!' for the flag. Ensure these are mixed dynamically to avoid audio clutter.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The sheer number of distinct sound cues and visual events, coupled with dialogue, could easily push the duration over 35 seconds if not meticulously paced. Aggressive editing of each audio element and visual cut is paramount to maintain compliance.",
      "The sheer density of distinct visual and auditory events means there's a very high risk of exceeding the 35-second duration if not meticulously planned. Each action needs to be extremely brief to fit, and any hesitation or drawn-out sound effect will immediately put us out of compliance.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the narrative beats and visual elements into the tight 35-second duration without feeling overly rushed or sacrificing the clarity of individual actions and their corresponding audio cues, especially for the Instagram audience.",
      "Ensuring the perfect synchronization between the aggressive sound effects and the rapid visual changes is critical to avoid jarring transitions or missed impacts, which could detract from the 'comic book explosion' aesthetic."

The 'I am eternal!' dialogue should have a slightly deeper, reverberating tone to emphasize its comic-book villain feel.",
      "Consider a slightly distorted, powerful voice for 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' to enhance the comic book superhero feel.  The pacing of these lines must be brisk to fit the 35-second duration, with minimal room for reverb or delays.",
      "Layer aggressive, distinct sound effects for each action: 'CRASH!' for the Knesset wall breach, 'WHOOSH!' for vanishing opposition, 'BOOM!' for exploding coalition panels, 'ZAP!' for texting trials, 'THWACK!' for energy beam settlements, 'CRACK!' for the judicial reform split, and 'WHAM!' for the flag. Ensure these are mixed dynamically to avoid audio clutter.",
      "Allocate 2-3 seconds max per visual event/dialogue snippet to ensure all 8 distinct actions (Knesset crash, vanishing opposition, exploding panels, juggling trials, settlements, judicial reform, repeated return, flag) are covered within 35 seconds.",
      "The voiceover needs to be energetic and slightly theatrical, perhaps with a subtle reverb, to amplify the 'superhero' feel and ensure clarity over the aggressive sound effects, fitting the 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' dialogue.",

      "For this 'Marvel Comics explosion!' concept, the audio strategy must be highly aggressive and perfectly synchronized to match the rapid, impactful visual cues. We need to leverage distinct, over-the-top comic book sound effects that punctuate each action, ensuring they are precisely timed to land within the 35-second window for maximum engagement on Instagram.",
      "For this 'Marvel Comics explosion!' concept, the audio needs to be incredibly punchy and precisely timed to match the rapid visual beats. Each sound effect \u2013 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!' \u2013 must feel like a comic panel transition, emphasizing the over-the-top, high-energy nature for maximum Instagram impact.",
      "For this 'Marvel Comics explosion!' concept, the audio must be extremely dynamic and character-driven, mirroring the over-the-top visual narrative. Each sound effect, particularly the onomatopoeia like 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', and 'BOOM!', needs to be sharp, layered, and precisely timed to the visual cues to maintain the rapid-fire, comic-book pacing essential for Instagram engagement within the 35-second window."
