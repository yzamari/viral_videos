1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,488
The war room crackles with

2
00:00:01,488 --> 00:00:02,332
tension.

3
00:00:02,332 --> 00:00:05,711
Countdown timers relentlessly tick

4
00:00:05,711 --> 00:00:07,391
down, six days until the

5
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:07,588
precipice.

6
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:08,375
Generals demand immediate action;

7
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,316
attack now.

8
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:10,727
The hour cries

9
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:12,225
out for bold strategy.

10
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:12,599
What

11
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,751
would Ben-Gurion have done?

12
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:14,039
A

13
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,316
transformation unfolds.

14
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:17,231
The mild-mannered Prime

15
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:20,544
Minister becomes a wartime leader.

16
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:21,839
Eshkol, with a decisive fist-slam,

17
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,740
makes his choice.

18
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,007
Sinai is

19
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:25,300
ours.

20
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,471
The map explodes, territory

21
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:28,430
triples in size.

22
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,735
Jerusalem is

23
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:30,100
united.

24
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,559
The leader's voice weakens,

25
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:32,404
his final breaths shallow.

26
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:32,615
The

27
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,201
Anxious Avenger falls.

28
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:33,591
Next time:

29
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:34,176
Golda's era dawns.
