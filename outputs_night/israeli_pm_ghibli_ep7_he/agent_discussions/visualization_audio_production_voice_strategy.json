The audio should build with the narrative, using a determined yet slightly mystical tone, peaking with the impactful quote. Sound design will be crucial for the 'mystical winds' and 'glowing tunnels,' creating an immersive experience that respects the historical gravitas within the 64-second timeframe.",
