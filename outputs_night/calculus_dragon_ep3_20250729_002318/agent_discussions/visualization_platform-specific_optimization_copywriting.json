Leverage the animated title card to immediately hook viewers, and ensure each math demonstration is a quick, humorous visual gag. The 'unknown duration' allows for flexibility, but breaking down each test into 15-30 second segments with clear subtitles will maximize watch time and engagement.",

We need to ensure the animated title card is a guaranteed click and the math concepts are instantly digestible through short, comical visual gags.
