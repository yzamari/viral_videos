    "For Instagram: Mix and match hashtags from different categories. Place the most important primary hashtags first. Consider using a few less common but highly relevant niche hashtags to capture specific audiences. Avoid using the exact same set of hashtags on every post; rotate and experiment.",
    "For broader reach across platforms: If cross-posting, adapt hashtag strategy. For TikTok, prioritize trending audio and challenge hashtags. For YouTube, focus on descriptive, searchable terms related to calculus and animation.",
    "Hashtag Placement: On Instagram, hashtags can be placed in the caption or the first comment.",
    "Quantity: While Instagram allows up to 30 hashtags, using around 15-25 relevant and varied hashtags is often effective. For this specific set, all 30 are provided as requested, but prioritize the most relevant ones for individual posts.",
    "Analyze Performance: Regularly check which hashtags are driving the most impressions and engagement to refine your strategy over time."
