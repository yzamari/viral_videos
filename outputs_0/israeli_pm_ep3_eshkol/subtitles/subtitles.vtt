00:00.000 --> 00:01.488
The war room crackles with

00:01.488 --> 00:02.333
tension.

00:02.333 --> 00:05.712
Countdown timers relentlessly tick

00:05.712 --> 00:07.392
down, six days until the

00:07.392 --> 00:07.589
precipice.

00:07.589 --> 00:08.376
Generals demand immediate action;

00:08.376 --> 00:09.317
attack now.

00:09.317 --> 00:10.728
The hour cries

00:10.728 --> 00:12.226
out for bold strategy.

00:12.226 --> 00:12.600
What

00:12.600 --> 00:13.752
would Ben-Gurion have done?

00:13.752 --> 00:14.040
A

00:14.040 --> 00:15.317
transformation unfolds.

00:15.317 --> 00:17.232
The mild-mannered Prime

00:17.232 --> 00:20.544
Minister becomes a wartime leader.

00:20.544 --> 00:21.840
Eshkol, with a decisive fist-slam,

00:21.840 --> 00:23.741
makes his choice.

00:23.741 --> 00:25.008
Sinai is

00:25.008 --> 00:25.301
ours.

00:25.301 --> 00:26.472
The map explodes, territory

00:26.472 --> 00:28.430
triples in size.

00:28.430 --> 00:29.736
Jerusalem is

00:29.736 --> 00:30.101
united.

00:30.101 --> 00:31.560
The leader's voice weakens,

00:31.560 --> 00:32.405
his final breaths shallow.

00:32.405 --> 00:32.616
The

00:32.616 --> 00:33.201
Anxious Avenger falls.

00:33.201 --> 00:33.591
Next time:

00:33.591 --> 00:34.176
Golda's era dawns.
