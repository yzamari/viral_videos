The audio strategy should be layered and dynamic, ensuring the 3-second title card explodes with sound and then seamlessly transitions to a playful, engaging soundscape for the comedy and math segments.",

We need a punchy, high-energy opening for the 3-second title card, immediately followed by the dragon's voice being energetic and slightly goofy, with clear, distinct sound effects for each math demonstration to aid comprehension and comedy. The zero-gravity moments should have subtle, airy soundscapes to enhance the absurdity.",

The audio needs to dynamically support the fast pacing and ensure clarity for the math concepts, even during the zero-gravity gags, all within the 40-second window.",
