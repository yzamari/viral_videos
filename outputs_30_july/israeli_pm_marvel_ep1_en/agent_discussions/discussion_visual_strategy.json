    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For maximum impact, the opening 'bursts from desert sands' and 'I am INEVITABLE!' dialogue should be paired with a dramatic visual reveal and the 'SNAP!' effect, using a quick, sharp edit to capture attention immediately., The British Mandate vanishing in comic smoke and the Declaration of Independence with exploding panels should be executed as rapid, stylized transitions with clear 'KA-POW!' sound effects to reinforce the comic book aesthetic and convey immense power., Prioritize the 'burst from desert sands' and 'INEVITABLE' snap as a strong opening hook, dedicating approximately 5-7 seconds to each for maximum initial impact.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The main concern is fitting all distinct visual and narrative beats into the precise 35-second window without feeling rushed. Each element needs to be a micro-moment of visual and audio impact, requiring tight editing and efficient storytelling.",

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Prioritize the 'bursts from desert sands' and 'British Mandate vanishes' moments for strong visual and audio impact early on, potentially dedicating 5-7 seconds each to maximize engagement. Integrate exaggerated comic book sound effects like 'KA-POW!' for the exploding panels and a distinct 'SNAP!' for the vanishing mandate, ensuring they are perfectly synced with the visuals and dialogue.",

      "Ensure the 'British Mandate vanishes' and 'Declaration of Independence with exploding panels' moments are visually distinct and punchy, ideally using exaggerated comic book sound effects like 'SNAP!' and 'KA-POW!' synchronized precisely with the visuals, each sequence lasting no more than 3-4 seconds.",
      "Condense the yoga headstands and kibbutz building into very brief, dynamic flashes (1-2 seconds each) to maintain visual interest without bogging down the pace."
