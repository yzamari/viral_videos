00:00.000 --> 00:01.632
Behold, the young Rabin!

00:01.632 --> 00:05.520
A beacon of hope,

00:05.520 --> 00:09.408
his Star of David

00:09.408 --> 00:10.470
shield gleaming brightly.

00:10.470 --> 00:10.824
From

00:10.824 --> 00:11.832
soldier to statesman, a

00:11.832 --> 00:13.560
remarkable transformation unfolds.

00:13.560 --> 00:14.136
A

00:14.136 --> 00:16.080
new era dawns.

00:16.080 --> 00:16.728
Entebbe!

00:16.728 --> 00:18.648
Commandos launch a daring

00:18.648 --> 00:19.308
night raid.

00:19.308 --> 00:19.968
The nation

00:19.968 --> 00:21.432
faces a crippling economic

00:21.432 --> 00:21.774
crisis;

00:21.774 --> 00:22.458
prosperity vanishes.

00:22.458 --> 00:22.800
Scandal

00:22.800 --> 00:23.262
erupts;

00:23.262 --> 00:24.648
betrayal is revealed.

00:24.648 --> 00:25.512
His shield falls;

00:25.512 --> 00:25.800
'I

00:25.800 --> 00:26.712
will return,' he vows.

00:26.712 --> 00:27.102
Post-credit:

00:27.102 --> 00:28.272
A chilling grin;

00:28.272 --> 00:31.224
a dark future looms.

00:31.224 --> 00:31.963
A future assassination casts a long
shadow.

00:31.963 --> 00:32.280
To be continued...
