All aboard the Sequence Express! Each car represents a , a₂, a₃… CHOO CHOO! We are headed to the limit. This train journey approaches station L. Convergence means approaching closer and closer. The Epsilon tunnel brings us within epsilon of L. What a feat! The unique limit theorem guarantees only one destination. No detours are permitted. Bounded sequences remain on track, never straying too far. They are dependable travelers. The arithmetic of limits functions , multiplication, all work perfectly. It is mathematical magic! The Sandwich theorem is a delightful delicious sequence sandwich! Even epsilon chicks converge beautifully
