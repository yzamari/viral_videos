# Video Generation Summary

## Session Information
- **Session ID**: calculus_dragon_ep2_20250727_165211
- **Mission**: Family Guy style: Baby dragon conductor on magical number train! 'All aboard the SEQUENCE EXPRESS!' Each train car shows a term: a₁=1, a₂=1/2, a₃=1/3... CHOO CHOO! 'Watch the pattern - each term follows a rule!' The train heads toward LIMIT STATION at L=0. 'CONVERGENCE means we get closer and closer to L!' Dragon demonstrates: 'Pick ANY tiny distance ε>0.' Magic epsilon tunnel appears! 'After some point N, ALL terms stay within ε of L!' Shows |aₙ-L|<ε visually. 'The UNIQUE LIMIT THEOREM says only ONE destination possible!' Two tracks can't lead to different stations! BOUNDED sequences have safety rails - can't go to infinity. 'If -M ≤ aₙ ≤ M for all n, we're bounded!' ARITHMETIC OF LIMITS: Two trains approaching L and M. 'Their sum approaches L+M!' Product approaches L×M! Dragon makes sequence sandwich: If aₙ ≤ bₙ ≤ cₙ and outer sequences → L, then bₙ → L too! 'SQUEEZE THEOREM!' Epsilon chicks line up showing 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4... converging to 0!
