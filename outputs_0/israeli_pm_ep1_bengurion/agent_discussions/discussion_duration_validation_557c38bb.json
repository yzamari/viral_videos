By synchronizing visuals and sound with the described comic panels, we create an engaging and immersive experience that aligns with the platform's short-form video format, aiming for high recall and emotional resonance.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds per major action panel (e.g., Ben-Gurion bursting, Mandate vanishing, independence declaration) to allow for visual impact and primary sound effects (BOOM, SNAP, KA-POW). The montage and tech panels can be quicker, around 3-5 seconds each, to maintain momentum.",
        "Utilize distinct, high-impact sound effects for each comic panel action (e.g., 'BOOM' for explosion, 'SNAP' for the vanishing, 'KA-POW' for declaration, 'WHOOSH' for movement) and integrate voiceover snippets ('I am... INEVITABLE!', 'Finally, peace.') to align with the visuals and enhance the comic-book aesthetic. Ensure the final teaser and editor's note are delivered with a confident, authoritative tone."

        "The primary concern is achieving precise timing across all 8 segments to fit within the 61.75-68.25 second window, especially with the rapid-fire nature of the mission description. Each sound effect and visual transition needs to be meticulously coordinated to avoid overrunning or underutilizing the allocated time."
