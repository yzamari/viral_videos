Precise audio-visual synchronization is crucial, especially for the 'dancing' element, to ensure immediate comedic impact.",

We need to define distinct robotic 'voices' that convey their unique personalities and the comedic essence of their dancing, focusing on how their vocalizations perform rather than just make noise.",

          "message": "As SoundDesigner, my focus is on crafting the specific robotic sound effects that bring the 'dancing robots' to life, emphasizing their comedic timing and reinforcing their unique personalities. We must select a precise palette of mechanical clanks, whirs, and perhaps even surprising, exaggerated sounds to punctuate their dance moves, ensuring each comedic gesture lands with maximum impact. This detailed sound design is crucial for delivering the punchlines and establishing a memorable audio signature for these characters.",
