00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
Sparky's rocket pack is a sequence;

00:01.920 --> 00:02.560
will it

00:02.860 --> 00:04.231
reach the stars or fizzle?

00:04.231 --> 00:05.054
We test its

00:05.354 --> 00:06.739
divergence with rocket launches.

00:06.739 --> 00:08.123
Even shrinking spells cannot

00:08.423 --> 00:10.043
stop its epic ascent.

00:10.043 --> 00:11.662
Nth roots approaching one

00:11.962 --> 00:17.318
mirror Sparky's planetary aim, a slow but
sure

00:17.618 --> 00:18.313
approach.

00:18.313 --> 00:23.182
For growing plants, the ratio test shows

00:23.482 --> 00:26.247
rapid growth, similar to Sparky's rocket
engine.

00:26.247 --> 00:26.642
The

00:26.942 --> 00:28.931
root test also reveals amazing growth
rates.

00:28.931 --> 00:29.215
Sparky's

00:29.515 --> 00:30.562
rocket found infinity.

00:30.562 --> 00:33.355
Sequences either converge or diverge with
rocket-fueled speed
