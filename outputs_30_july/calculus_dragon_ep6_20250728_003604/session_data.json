  "mission": "Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon in power-up workshop teaches rational and real exponents, then explores topology. Cover fractional powers, real exponents as limits, accumulation points, isolated points, open and closed sets, interior and closure, and the Cantor set. Use visual metaphors: power transformations, dragon gatherings, bubble zones, fractal magic. Make topology concepts accessible and fun.",

    "original_script": "[VISUAL: Baby dragon Sparky in a 'Power-Up Workshop' surrounded by levers and gears] DIALOGUE: Welcome to Sparky's Power-Up Workshop! Today, we master exponents, like turning a cute dragon into a fiery inferno! [VISUAL: Sparky demonstrates fractional powers with glowing orbs, a dragon gathering forms] DIALOGUE: Fractional powers? Imagine sharing a single dragon's might. It is just dividing the power-up! Simple, right? [VISUAL: Sparky shows real exponents using a 'limit' slider and expanding bubble zones] DIALOGUE: Real exponents are like infinite power-ups. We approach a number using limits. See the bubbles grow closer? [VISUAL: Sparky points to distinct points (isolated) and areas without boundaries (open/closed sets) with fractal magic swirls] DIALOGUE: Topology explores spaces. Some points are all alone, while others have boundaries. It is all about connections! [VISUAL: Sparky reveals a simplified Cantor set visualization with a 'magic' flourish] DIALOGUE: This is the Cantor set, a fractal masterpiece. It is a perfect example of infinity within limits. Mind blown, humans!",
