Prioritize punchy sound effects for mathematical obstacles, powerful fire breath, and dramatic train explosions.  The 'Squeeze Theorem as a Weapon' moment requires a distinct, impactful sonic signature to solidify its use as a key plot device.",

The initial 3-second animated title card must be exceptionally high-energy to grab attention immediately. We need to ensure the mathematical concepts are visually translated into dynamic action sequences, making each 'train car' segment distinct and fast-paced, fitting within the target duration.",

The rapid-fire pacing, Family Guy parody style, and fantastical elements are perfect for the platform's short-form video consumption.
