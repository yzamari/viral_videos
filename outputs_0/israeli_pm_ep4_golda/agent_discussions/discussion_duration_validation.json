    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate approximately 7-8 seconds per major panel sequence (e.g., 'SMOKE PANEL', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'YOM KIPPUR WAR'). This will allow for visual storytelling, sound design, and brief dialogue delivery, fitting within the target duration with ~8 segments., Employ a distinct, powerful sound effect for each 'POW!', 'KABOOM!', and 'SNAP!' to emphasize the action and comic-book feel. For 'TIME REWIND PANELS', a subtle tape rewind sound will be crucial for clarity. The 'Internet EXPLODES' should be a cacophony of digital sounds and notification pings. For the 'intelligence failure', a sharp sound of scattering papers and a distorted 'error' tone will be effective., Allocate approximately 4-6 seconds per major narrative beat (e.g., 'SMOKE PANEL', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'YOM KIPPUR WAR', 'Kitchen Diplomacy', 'Resignation', 'Final Panel'). This allows for the full scope of the mission to be presented without sacrificing detail.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is the potential for sensory overload or loss of narrative clarity if the pacing is too rapid. Each panel's message must be digestible despite the speed.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring each distinct element of the mission brief (from the glowing cigarette to the internet explosion) is visually and audibly represented without feeling rushed or losing its impact. Balancing the visual density with clear audio cues for each event within the 65-second window is critical.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the distinct narrative points ('SMOKE PANEL', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'YOM KIPPUR WAR', 'Intelligence failure', 'TIME REWIND', 'Kitchen diplomacy', 'Resignation', 'Final panel') into the tight timeframe without making it feel rushed or incoherent. Each element needs enough screen time to register its impact."

      "Allocate approximately 4-5 seconds per panel for visual impact and sound effects, with 2-3 seconds dedicated to dialogue or narrative text overlays, ensuring the entire 65-second window is utilized effectively across all 8 segments.",
      "Utilize a 'flashback' visual effect for the 'TIME REWIND PANELS' and a dramatic 'shrink' animation for 'Kitchen diplomacy' to visually communicate complex ideas concisely and impactfully, enhancing emotional engagement.",
      "Allocate approximately 7-8 seconds per major panel sequence (e.g., 'SMOKE PANEL', 'TRANSFORMATION', 'YOM KIPPUR WAR'). This will allow for visual storytelling, sound design, and brief dialogue delivery, fitting within the target duration with ~8 segments.",
      "Utilize dynamic camera movements and quick cuts to simulate comic book panels, enhancing visual energy and keeping the audience engaged. Overlaying classic comic sound effects like 'KABOOM!', 'SNAP!', and 'POW!' will reinforce the style and impact."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To effectively accomplish the mission on Instagram within the \u00b15% duration constraint, we will leverage dynamic visual pacing and impactful audio cues. Each panel description will be condensed into a concise, punchy visual segment, supported by sharp sound effects and minimal, highly charged dialogue. The key is to create an immediate, almost overwhelming sensory experience that conveys the narrative's intensity and Golda Meir's formidable presence within the tight timeframe.",
      "To achieve the Marvel-style Golda Meir narrative on Instagram within the 65 \u00b15% second window, we'll prioritize rapid-fire visual storytelling with impactful comic book sound effects and minimal, sharp dialogue. Each panel's essence will be distilled into a 3-5 second visual beat, maximizing the narrative density. The key is to create a powerful, almost overwhelming impression of Golda's strength and decisiveness, culminating in the explosive final statement, ensuring every frame drives home her commanding presence and the geopolitical context.",
      "To strategically accomplish the 'Marvel Comics: SMOKE PANEL!' mission on Instagram, we will synchronize rapid-fire visual storytelling with powerful sound design and concise, impactful dialogue, ensuring each of the 8 distinct narrative beats is delivered within an average of 8 seconds. This approach prioritizes conveying Golda Meir's commanding presence and the historical weight of the events through dynamic comic-style panels and sharp audio cues, maximizing emotional resonance and message clarity within the strict duration."

    "The mission's narrative is dense and action-packed, mirroring a comic book's rapid-fire panels. By translating this into short, impactful video segments with corresponding audio, we can maintain viewer engagement and deliver the core message effectively. This approach prioritizes synchronization and auditory impact, aligning perfectly with the persona of AudioMaster.",
    "This approach directly addresses the mission's need for a punchy, comic-book-style narrative within a strict Instagram duration. Focusing on rapid visual pacing and sonic impact will convey the high-stakes events and Golda's formidable character, crucial for persuading viewers of her strength and influence within the allocated time.",
    "This approach directly addresses the mission's core elements by translating a complex narrative into visually dynamic, short segments suitable for Instagram, while adhering to the precise timing requirements.  The synchronization of visuals, sound, and dialogue is key to delivering the intended powerful message and historical context within the given constraints."
