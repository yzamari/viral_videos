Integers show up with negative temperatures. WHOOSH! Rational numbers as pizza slices. 'Mind blown!' Irrational numbers as infinite dragons. Real numbers form a beautiful number line. Absolute value is like dragon hugs - always positive! Intervals are dragon nap zones. Bounded sets are like dragon cages. Supremum is the tallest dragon! Completeness means no gaps in our number line! Epsilon chicks chirp: '\u03b5 > 0!'",
