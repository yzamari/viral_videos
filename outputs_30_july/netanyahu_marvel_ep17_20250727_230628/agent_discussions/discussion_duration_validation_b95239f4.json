      "suggestions": [
        "Prioritize aggressive cuts and impactful sound design for each described action: 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', 'WHAM!'. Ensure each sound effect is distinct and complements the visual, creating a rapid-fire, attention-grabbing experience.",
