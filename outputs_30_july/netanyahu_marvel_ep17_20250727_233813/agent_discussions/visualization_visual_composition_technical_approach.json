Each distinct action must be visually condensed and paired with impactful, exaggerated sound effects and bold on-screen text to ensure clarity and maintain viewer interest within the tight 35-second timeframe. The sheer density of visual events requires meticulous pacing and precise synchronization of audio-visual cues to convey the intended hyper-kinetic energy.",

We need to visually translate each distinct action \u2013 the crash, the vanishing, the exploding panels \u2013 into distinct, short visual bursts, almost like rapid-fire comic panels. The key to engagement on Instagram here is delivering a high-energy, almost overwhelming sensory experience that demands attention immediately and maintains it through relentless visual and auditory cues.",
