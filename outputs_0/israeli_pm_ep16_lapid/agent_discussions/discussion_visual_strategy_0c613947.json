Transition to the UN speech panel with 'TWO STATES!' audio. Immediately follow with a 'pop' or 'explode' sound effect as 'Right-wing heads EXPLODE!' text appears. Visuals: Blurred quick cuts of policy wins, then a sharp cut to a formal UN setting with text overlay. Audio: Music tempo increases, a dramatic sting for the UN speech, and a cartoonish 'explosion' sound for the reaction., Segment 3 (15-25s): 'SCANNER-STYLE!' visuals with news ticker-like text. Transition to 'TV host panels: Mirror admiration! 'HANDSOME PM!' Heart eyes everywhere!' Use enthusiastic news clips and visual 'heart' effects.
