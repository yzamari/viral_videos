Look, the dragon is stuck in a time loop!  Recursive sequences mean next term depends on previous. We can find the limits of these recursive sequences.  It is like the dragon's journey. The number e appears: Natural dragon growth!  This is a key mathematical constant. Here is Cantor's lemma with nested dragon boxes!  Each box is smaller than the last. Subsequences are like dragon cousins.  They are related but distinct. Bolzano-Weierstrass states: Every bounded sequence has a convergent cousin!  The dragon always finds a way.",
    "final_script": "Behold, a baby dragon perched atop an endless staircase! Monotonic means always ascending or always descending. This dragon is never falling. Bounded and monotonic implies convergence. The dragon is trapped, caught in a time loop! Each step in this recursive sequence depends on the previous one. We can determine the limits of these sequences. It mirrors the dragon's journey. The number *e* symbol of natural dragon growth, a key mathematical constant. Observe Cantor's dragon boxes, each smaller than the last. Subsequences are like the dragon's kin, related yet distinct. The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem assures bounded sequence possesses a convergent subsequence. The dragon always finds its way",
