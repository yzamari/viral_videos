    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Script Structure: Start with the most visually striking element (Knesset wall crash) and maintain a rapid-fire pace, dedicating approximately 3-4 seconds to each distinct action/gag, ensuring sound effects land perfectly on visual cues. This allows for 8-10 distinct moments within the 35-second window., Viral Hooks: The 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' lines, delivered with exaggerated villainous flair, will serve as memorable audio hooks. Visually, the vanishing opposition and the 'nation splitting' gag offer strong, easily shareable moments of satire., For the 'Juggling multiple corruption trials while texting' segment, use a rapid montage of incoming notifications and abstract 'trial' icons flashing, all accompanied by a frantic 'ZAP!' sound effect to convey overwhelming multitasking.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Ensuring the rapid succession of distinct visual and auditory events doesn't become chaotic or overwhelming for the viewer within the short timeframe is a significant challenge, risking a loss of clarity in the satire.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the described events and dialogue into 35 seconds without making it feel rushed or losing the comedic impact of each individual gag. Overlapping actions or insufficient visual storytelling for each point could dilute the overall effect.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring that the numerous, distinct actions can all be effectively conveyed visually and audibly within the tight timeframe without feeling rushed or losing clarity, which requires meticulous timing and editing."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Allocate no more than 3 seconds per individual action (e.g., crashing, vanishing, exploding) to fit all elements. Each sound effect (CRASH, WHOOSH, BOOM, etc.) MUST perfectly punctuate the visual climax of its associated gag to create instant recognition.",
      "The 'Judicial reform controversy splits the nation' should be visualized with a dramatic comic-style crack across a map or a physical representation of Israel, immediately followed by Netanyahu's defiant 'Bibi will return... again!' line, amplified with a resonant 'CRACK!' sound.",
      "The dialogue 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' should be delivered with a deep, slightly distorted voice, layered with a subtle reverb or echo, and timed to land at the apex of the dramatic visual cues for maximum impact and 'villainous' effect.",
      "For the 'Juggling multiple corruption trials while texting' segment, use a rapid montage of incoming notifications and abstract 'trial' icons flashing, all accompanied by a frantic 'ZAP!' sound effect to convey overwhelming multitasking.",
      "Viral Hooks: The 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' lines, delivered with exaggerated villainous flair, will serve as memorable audio hooks. Visually, the vanishing opposition and the 'nation splitting' gag offer strong, easily shareable moments of satire.",

  "key_insights": [
    "The sheer density of actions and sound cues in this specific topic demands a hyper-paced, visually driven narrative.
