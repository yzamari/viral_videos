      "message": "To maximize engagement for 'Dragon Detective Agency' on Instagram, we need to lean heavily into the comedic Family Guy style with sharp dialogue and relatable function-analysis metaphors. The 'unknown duration' for Instagram content suggests a flexible approach, likely a series of Reels or a longer IGTV episode, emphasizing a strong hook with the animated title card to capture attention immediately. The core of the strategy should be translating complex calculus concepts into visually engaging 'case files' that the dragon detective solves, ensuring clarity and humor.",

      "concerns": [
        "The primary concern is balancing the comedic Family Guy tone with the educational value of systematic function analysis; ensuring the humor doesn't overshadow the learning is critical for ROI. Also, the 'unknown duration' needs to be clarified to tailor pacing and content depth effectively for Instagram's various formats."
