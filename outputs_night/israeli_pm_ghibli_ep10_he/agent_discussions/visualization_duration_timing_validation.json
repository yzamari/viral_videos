          "message": "To achieve the 'Studio Ghibli magic' for Shimon Peres on TikTok, we need to synchronize each visual element precisely with the narrative's optimistic and dreamlike tone. The 64-second target duration means each of the 8 segments will average 8 seconds, requiring concise visual storytelling and dialogue to convey complex ideas like 'peace agreements transform into origami cranes' and 'teaching robots to dance the hora' effectively.  This necessitates a tight workflow between CutMaster and AudioMaster to ensure the emotional arc builds within the platform's typical viewing patterns.",
