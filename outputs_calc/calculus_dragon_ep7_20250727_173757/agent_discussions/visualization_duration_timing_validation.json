Each segment will be timed precisely to fit within the 63-second target, ensuring maximum engagement and comprehension. We will use relatable analogies and energetic narration to make complex mathematical ideas accessible and exciting for the target audience.",

Each concept will be introduced with a visual transformation and a concise, relatable explanation, ensuring all segments fit within the 63-second target. We'll focus on showcasing the 'dragon's territory' (domain) and 'transformations' (range) visually, making abstract math tangible and engaging for an Instagram audience.",
