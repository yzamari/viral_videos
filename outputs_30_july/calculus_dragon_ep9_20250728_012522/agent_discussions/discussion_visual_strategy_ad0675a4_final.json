    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For the Extreme Value Theorem, visualize the dragon desperately trying to reach the absolute highest, glittering pile of gold within a cave system (closed interval), then immediately pan to it sulking near the only empty treasure chest in the entire hoard (min). Use quick cuts and Peter Griffin-esque grunts for comedic effect., Represent derivatives as the dragon's flight path: show its speedometer fluctuating wildly on a jagged, treacherous mountain ascent (high positive derivative) versus a slow glide over a flat, boring field (near zero derivative). A steep downhill plummet towards a treasure could be a sharp negative derivative., To demonstrate continuity and differentiability, show the dragon attempting to fly a perfectly smooth, continuous path to a treasure, but encountering a sudden chasm (discontinuity). Then, depict a path that has a sharp, impossible-to-navigate spike or a 'corner' that it can't turn smoothly (non-differentiable point).",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting the sheer volume of mathematical concepts (EVM, uniform continuity, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor, derivatives, differentiability/continuity) into just 35 seconds without the explanations becoming too rushed or nonsensical, potentially alienating the audience.",
      "Ensuring the visual metaphors are immediately understandable and humorously integrated within the Family Guy style is critical. If the metaphors are too abstract or the humor too niche, the educational aspect will be lost, and the video might not perform well on Instagram.",
      "The primary concern is the sheer density of concepts to cover. Even with strong visual metaphors, explaining the Extreme Value Theorem, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor, and derivatives, along with their relationships, in under 35 seconds risks being too fast and confusing for the average Instagram viewer, potentially sacrificing clarity for humor.",
      "The primary concern remains fitting all the specified complex mathematical concepts (Extreme Value Theorem, uniform continuity, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor theorem, derivatives, differentiability/continuity) into a mere 35 seconds while maintaining a Family Guy comedic style and ensuring clarity. This is an extremely tight constraint that will require very economical storytelling and visual design."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "The Heine-Cantor theorem could be shown by the dragon needing to find a treasure on a specific platform, and no matter how slightly it adjusts its approach (perturbation), it always lands exactly on the treasure without missing it, implying a predictable outcome.",
      "Uniform continuity can be illustrated by the dragon needing to cover a certain distance with consistent effort, regardless of whether it's flying over a flat desert or bumpy terrain, ensuring it doesn't 'get tired' too quickly.",
      "Heine-Cantor theorem might be visualized as the dragon needing to navigate a series of shifting treasure tunnels; even with minor path adjustments, it can still guarantee reaching a treasure chest without falling into a 'gap'.",
      "Visualize monotonic bijections as a treasure map that consistently leads to increasingly valuable treasure spots without ever looping back or skipping a level of value. The dragon follows it with blind, greedy faith.",
      "Monotonic bijections could be shown with a treasure map that consistently leads to progressively richer treasure spots, each uniquely identifiable.",
      "To illustrate 'derivative as instantaneous rate of change,' show the dragon rapidly flying along a winding mountain path. A speedometer on its neck displays its current speed, directly correlating to the slope of the mountain at that exact point. A sudden acceleration or deceleration is a visual cue for a steeper or shallower slope, respectively.",
      "For the Extreme Value Theorem, depict the dragon frantically digging through a mountain of gold (closed interval) to find the single largest gem (max) and a single pebble (min).",
      "To show derivatives as instantaneous rate of change, have the dragon speed up or slow down on a chase scene, with a 'gold-per-second' meter on its neck showing its current velocity.",
      "The relationship between differentiability and continuity should be demonstrated by contrasting the dragon's smooth flight path between treasures (continuous and differentiable) with a path that abruptly jumps or has a sharp, broken turn (discontinuous/non-differentiable), causing it to drop some loot.",
      "For 'monotonic bijections,' visualize a treasure map that consistently leads to progressively more valuable loot with each step, ensuring a predictable, upward trend in wealth. This can be a map where each 'X' marks a spot with more gold than the last.",
      "For 'max/min on closed intervals,' show the dragon scanning a vast treasure cave, its eyes zooming to the absolute highest pile of gold (max) and then the deepest, emptiest chest (min) within that defined cave area. Use quick cuts and a 'ding!' sound effect for each discovery.",
      "For the Extreme Value Theorem, visualize the dragon desperately trying to reach the absolute highest, glittering pile of gold within a cave system (closed interval), then immediately pan to it sulking near the only empty treasure chest in the entire hoard (min). Use quick cuts and Peter Griffin-esque grunts for comedic effect.",
      "To convey the 'Heine-Cantor theorem' visually, show the dragon attempting to navigate a precarious treasure path. Even with minor wobbles or shifts in its flight plan, it always lands precisely on a treasure chest without any unexpected 'jumps' or gaps in its trajectory, guaranteeing a continuous and predictable landing.",
      "Represent derivatives as the dragon's flight path: show its speedometer fluctuating wildly on a jagged, treacherous mountain ascent (high positive derivative) versus a slow glide over a flat, boring field (near zero derivative). A steep downhill plummet towards a treasure could be a sharp negative derivative.",
      "To demonstrate continuity and differentiability, show the dragon attempting to fly a perfectly smooth, continuous path to a treasure, but encountering a sudden chasm (discontinuity). Then, depict a path that has a sharp, impossible-to-navigate spike or a 'corner' that it can't turn smoothly (non-differentiable point).",
      "Demonstrate the 'relationship between differentiability and continuity' by showing two flight paths: one a smooth, continuous arc that allows the dragon to precisely land on a treasure chest (differentiable and continuous), contrasted with a path that has a sudden, abrupt 'hop' or break, causing the dragon to miss its target (discontinuous and non-differentiable).",
      "Use Family Guy-style sound effects and voice-over for the dragon, with rapid-fire dialogue. For example, when the dragon reaches the peak treasure: 'MAXIMUM GOLD! Woo hoo!' and when it finds the empty chest: 'Ugh, another useless box.' This adds to the comedic pacing and reinforces the concepts."

      "To effectively convey the specified calculus concepts within a Family Guy-style comedy for Instagram's 35-second format, we must prioritize rapid-fire visual gags and extremely concise, punchy explanations tied directly to treasure hunting. Each concept needs a strong, easily digestible visual metaphor that leverages the dragon's persona and the treasure theme.",
      "To maximize engagement for this Family Guy-style calculus comedy on Instagram, we must prioritize visual clarity and comedic pacing, ensuring each concept is tightly linked to a treasure-hunting gag. The 35-second duration demands ruthless efficiency in concept delivery, using relatable, exaggerated scenarios that embody the mathematical principles.",
      "To create an engaging Family Guy-style calculus comedy for Instagram within 35 seconds, we must prioritize rapid, visual gags that directly translate each mathematical concept into a treasure-hunting scenario. The key is to use the dragon's character and exaggerated animations to explain derivatives as instantaneous 'dragon velocity' and continuity/differentiability through smooth vs. jagged flight paths, ensuring every visual serves both humor and clarity."
