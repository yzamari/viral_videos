00:01.842 --> 00:02.358
Netanyahu returned.

00:02.358 --> 00:02.616
Electrifying

00:02.616 --> 00:03.540
lightning crackled.

00:03.540 --> 00:04.464
Extremist stones

00:04.464 --> 00:06.336
glowed, assembled on the

00:06.336 --> 00:09.126
most right-wing panel.

00:09.126 --> 00:10.056
A

00:10.056 --> 00:12.840
snap attempt at judicial

00:12.840 --> 00:15.552
reform targeted the Supreme

00:15.552 --> 00:16.260
Court.

00:16.260 --> 00:18.384
Resistance erupted in

00:18.384 --> 00:19.080
furious protests.

00:19.080 --> 00:19.776
Half of

00:19.776 --> 00:20.688
Israel dissolved in dust,

00:20.688 --> 00:21.714
a shocking sight.

00:21.714 --> 00:22.056
October

00:22.056 --> 00:22.506
7th:

00:22.506 --> 00:23.856
the darkest day.

00:23.856 --> 00:28.824
The security shield shattered;

00:28.824 --> 00:30.420
Vibranium cracked.

00:30.420 --> 00:32.016
Gaza war

00:32.016 --> 00:34.680
panels declared total victory,

00:34.680 --> 00:36.096
empty speech bubbles for

00:36.096 --> 00:37.848
the hostages.

00:37.848 --> 00:39.600
An ICC

00:39.600 --> 00:40.704
warrant declared international villain

00:40.704 --> 00:41.232
status.

00:41.232 --> 00:42.816
Wanted posters plastered

00:42.816 --> 00:44.994
the desolate land.

00:44.994 --> 00:45.720
Polls

00:45.720 --> 00:45.996
plummeted;

00:45.996 --> 00:46.824
the coalition clung

00:46.824 --> 00:48.336
precariously, held together by

00:48.336 --> 00:48.696
Scotch tape.

00:48.696 --> 00:49.056
'After me,

00:49.056 --> 00:49.110
the flood!

00:49.110 --> 00:49.244
' echoed, a Noah-like vibe.

00:49.244 --> 00:49.459
The universe-ending panel showed him still
in power.

00:49.459 --> 00:49.486
Post-credit:

00:49.486 --> 00:49.567
'Democracy will return...?

00:49.567 --> 00:49.647
' The end...

00:49.647 --> 00:49.728
or is it?
