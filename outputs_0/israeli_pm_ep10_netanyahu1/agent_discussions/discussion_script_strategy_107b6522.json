The visual should clearly show the slight margin of victory., Allocate 8-10 seconds for the Western Wall tunnel opening, using a dramatic 'WHOOSH' sound effect, unsettling ambient tones for the 'PORTAL TO CHAOS,' and a distinct 'dissolving' sound for the peace process, mirroring Spider-Man's disintegration with a subtle particle effect.",
