      "reasoning": "Instagram's fast-paced environment demands immediate hook and sustained visual interest. By mapping calculus concepts to exaggerated ninja moves and incorporating quick, comedic payoff, we align with the platform's consumption habits and the Family Guy aesthetic.",
      "suggestions": [
        "For L'H\u00f4pital's Rule (0/0 and \u221e/\u221e), visualize the dragon attempting to fight a 'zero-by-zero' blob monster, then struggling with an 'infinity/infinity' cloud. The Master Ninja reveals the 'derivative split' technique, where the dragon performs a dual sword strike on both numerator and denominator entities simultaneously.",
        "For Darboux Theorem, represent it as a 'scroll of equal bounds' that the dragon must decipher. Its activation could create a 'trapdoor' of equal area under the curve, humorously trapping a villain or a misplaced item.",

        "The primary concern is the sheer density of calculus concepts (Darboux, L'H\u00f4pital's for multiple forms, advanced limits) that need to be conveyed humorously and clearly within a strict 35-second window. Overly complex visual metaphors or lengthy explanations will dilute the comedic impact and educational clarity.",
        "Ensuring the visual metaphors for advanced calculus techniques are instantly understandable, even to those with limited calculus knowledge, is crucial for broader Instagram appeal and virality. If the math explanation becomes too obscure, the humor might not land.",
        "Maintaining a consistent 'Family Guy' comedic tone while accurately representing calculus principles is a delicate balance. The humor must stem from the absurd application of math in a ninja context, not from misrepresenting the math itself."
