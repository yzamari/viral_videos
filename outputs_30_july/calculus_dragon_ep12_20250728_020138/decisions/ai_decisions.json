    "reasoning": "Family Guy's distinct visual style lends itself perfectly to a cartoon approach. Vibrant colors will enhance the magical and comedic elements, making the complex math concepts more engaging for a general Instagram audience. Visual metaphors like crystal balls and shrinking errors are naturally suited to animation.",

    "primary_overlay_position": "bottom_right",
    "positioning_strategy": "static",
    "reasoning": "For Instagram, the bottom 20% should be avoided. The bottom right offers a good balance, allowing the main visual content to dominate the center and top while keeping important text overlays readable without being intrusive. It's a common and effective placement for action buttons or descriptive text on the platform.",
