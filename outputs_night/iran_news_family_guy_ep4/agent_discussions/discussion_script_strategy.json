    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Emphasize over-the-top voice acting for Maryam, the teenager, and the IT minister. Ensure the 'Pigeons carrying USB drives' cutaway is quick and visually distinct, acting as a surreal punchline. Synchronize the news ticker text with a subtle, driving sound effect for maximum impact., Time the studio lights flickering with a sharp audio cue, like a glitch or hum, to precede Maryam's flask drink. The 'Coming Up' lower third should appear and disappear with a soft 'whoosh' sound, teasing future content without disrupting the flow., Emphasize quick, almost jarring transitions between Maryam, the teenager, and the IT minister. Consider using exaggerated facial expressions and vocal inflections to amplify the Family Guy tone.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Fitting all dialogue, visual gags, ticker, and the final studio flicker/flask sip within 40 seconds is the primary concern. Any delay in one segment will cascade and potentially exceed the limit, making precise timing essential.",
      "Ensuring the dialogue for the teenager and IT minister is short, punchy, and clearly audible, despite the inherent absurdity, within their allocated time slots without sacrificing clarity for subtitles.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the distinct visual and auditory elements (multiple characters, cutaway, ticker, sound cues) into precisely 40 seconds without feeling rushed or losing comedic timing. Each segment must be extremely concise."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "For viral potential, focus on the relatable, yet exaggerated, 'actual conversations' and 'talking to parents' horror. These points of shared, awkward human experience, filtered through Family Guy's lens, are highly shareable.",
      "The 'Pigeons carrying USB drives' cutaway and the 'Youth Discover Books Exist' ticker need to be visually distinct and fast, perhaps with a slight, retro VHS filter to enhance the absurdity. Time these for maximum comedic impact within their brief appearances.",
      "Time the studio lights flickering with a sharp audio cue, like a glitch or hum, to precede Maryam's flask drink. The 'Coming Up' lower third should appear and disappear with a soft 'whoosh' sound, teasing future content without disrupting the flow.",
      "Emphasize quick, almost jarring transitions between Maryam, the teenager, and the IT minister. Consider using exaggerated facial expressions and vocal inflections to amplify the Family Guy tone.",
      "Sync the flickering studio lights with a sharp audio glitch or a sudden drop in ambient noise just before Maryam drinks from her flask. This creates a dramatic, comedic beat that reinforces the show's visual and audio style.",
      "Allocate distinct audio processing (EQ, reverb, pitch) to Maryam, the teenager, and the IT minister to create immediate character recognition and enhance the 'Family Guy' feel. The 'Pigeons carrying USB drives' cutaway needs a quick, distorted sound effect to amplify the absurdity.",
      "Emphasize over-the-top voice acting for Maryam, the teenager, and the IT minister. Ensure the 'Pigeons carrying USB drives' cutaway is quick and visually distinct, acting as a surreal punchline. Synchronize the news ticker text with a subtle, driving sound effect for maximum impact.",
      "Technical precision in timing is key; the flickering studio lights should coincide with an audio glitch or sudden sting, immediately preceding Maryam's flask drink for a strong, darkly comedic closing visual. Ensure the lower third appears and disappears with a subtle sound effect to avoid jarring the viewer."
