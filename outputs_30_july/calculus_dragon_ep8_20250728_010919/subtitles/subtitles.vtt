00:00.000 --> 00:02.821
Alright Lois, see this smooth flight

00:03.121 --> 00:03.361
path?

00:03.361 --> 00:04.319
That is a limit.

00:04.319 --> 00:04.558
We

00:04.858 --> 00:08.097
approach the destination without actually
reaching

00:08.397 --> 00:09.037
it.

00:09.037 --> 00:12.237
If the dragon vanished and

00:12.537 --> 00:14.940
reappeared, that is not a limit;

00:15.240 --> 00:17.766
it is rude teleporting, Brian.

00:17.766 --> 00:18.271
We

00:18.571 --> 00:22.515
land from the left, we land

00:22.815 --> 00:23.677
from the right.

00:23.677 --> 00:24.539
Both directions must

00:24.839 --> 00:26.589
match, or the operation is chaotic.

00:26.889 --> 00:27.952
See that perfect landing?

00:27.952 --> 00:28.483
No sudden

00:28.783 --> 00:29.009
jolts.

00:29.009 --> 00:29.688
That is continuity.

00:29.688 --> 00:30.141
The flight

00:30.441 --> 00:31.713
is smooth.

00:31.713 --> 00:34.255
Even with altitude changes,

00:34.555 --> 00:35.600
the flight remains unbroken.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.735
It is all connected, like Stewie's evil
plans, but with more precision
