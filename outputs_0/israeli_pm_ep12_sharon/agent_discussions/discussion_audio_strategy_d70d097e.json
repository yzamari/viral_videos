The 'Punisher' segment needs a gritty, driving electronic beat, and the 'Kadima' creation a more determined, building rhythm. Finally, the 'Winter Soldier' coma period should have a low, sustained hum with occasional distorted vocal fragments, culminating in the multilingual 'legacy' tag with a fading, reflective ambient track.",
        "Utilize a dynamic voiceover performance: The narrator's tone should shift from authoritative and booming ('Nothing stops the Bulldozer!') to somber and reflective (Sabra-Shatila), sharp and decisive (Second Intifada), and finally, a more measured, slightly weary tone for the legacy statement. The 'Fine, I'll do it myself' line needs a distinct, determined inflection.
