00:00.000 --> 00:03.552
Distinguished faculty, esteemed guests,
fellow

00:03.552 --> 00:03.979
graduates.

00:03.979 --> 00:05.688
Today marks a momentous

00:05.688 --> 00:06.096
occasion.

00:06.096 --> 00:07.728
My name is Bibi

00:07.728 --> 00:07.944
Netanyahu;

00:07.944 --> 00:08.808
I am from Israel.

00:08.808 --> 00:10.032
I am ready to lead.

00:10.032 --> 00:14.328
A narrow victory, just one

00:14.328 --> 00:15.624
percent separated me from my

00:15.624 --> 00:16.229
opponent.

00:16.229 --> 00:18.648
The people have spoken.

00:18.648 --> 00:21.240
The Western Wall tunnel opening

00:21.240 --> 00:21.998
unleashed chaos.

00:21.998 --> 00:23.136
Spirits escaped, dissolving

00:23.136 --> 00:23.635
peace.

00:23.635 --> 00:25.632
Cigars and champagne flowed;

00:25.632 --> 00:28.560
a celebratory atmosphere filled the

00:28.560 --> 00:29.126
air.

00:29.126 --> 00:31.392
Sara, however, entered a

00:31.392 --> 00:32.381
furious rage.

00:32.381 --> 00:33.864
She unleashed her

00:33.864 --> 00:35.424
anger upon my political foes.

00:35.424 --> 00:36.614
The coalition unexpectedly collapsed.

00:36.614 --> 00:36.912
My

00:36.912 --> 00:38.582
heroic allies scattered.

00:38.582 --> 00:39.696
I disbanded

00:39.696 --> 00:40.752
the ranks.

00:40.752 --> 00:42.336
I will return,

00:42.336 --> 00:44.410
stronger and more determined.

00:44.410 --> 00:44.928
I

00:44.928 --> 00:48.456
will practice in mirrors, honing

00:48.456 --> 00:49.042
my image.

00:49.042 --> 00:49.920
One day, I

00:49.920 --> 00:50.155
will be the longest-serving leader.

00:50.155 --> 00:50.577
My vision for Israel is clear, unwavering,
and powerful.

00:50.577 --> 00:50.811
I will not be deterred.

00:50.811 --> 00:50.952
I will prevail.
