    "original_script": "Ariel Sharon, the Bulldozer, unstoppable force. His legend began with sheer, unyielding power. Sabra-Shatila\u2019s shadows danced like Mysterio\u2019s phantoms, a grim, illusory haunting. The Temple Mount visit, a casual walk, detonated like a hidden landmine of consequences. During the Second Intifada, Sharon embraced the Punisher\u2019s relentless, unyielding approach. Then, a surprising pivot: Gaza disengagement, settlers removed like Thanos with the Reality Stone. His own party revolted. He declared, 'Fine, I will do it myself,' forging Kadima. Thor\u2019s hammer fell: a stroke, eight years in a coma, body sustained like the Winter Soldier. He died, Gaza unresolved. His legacy: complicated, in every single language.",
