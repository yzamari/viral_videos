The 'I am eternal!' dialogue should have a slightly deeper, reverberating tone to emphasize its comic-book villain feel.",
        "Implement a rapid-fire visual-audio montage: Each scene (Knesset crash, vanishing opposition, exploding panels, juggling trials, energy beams, flag) should be presented in short, sharp bursts, no more than 2-3 seconds each. The sound effects must hit *exactly* at the visual moment of impact or transformation. For example, the 'CRASH!' must coincide precisely with Netanyahu breaking through the wall. The 'WHOOSH!' needs to occur as the opposition dissolves into smoke. The 'ZAP!' must align with the energy beam. This creates a relentless, engaging pace for Instagram."
