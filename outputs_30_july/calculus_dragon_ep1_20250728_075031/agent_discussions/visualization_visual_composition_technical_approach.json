The 35-second duration necessitates precise timing, allocating roughly 5-7 seconds per number set battle to showcase the monster, a joke, the property explanation, and a quick combat resolution.",

Each monster battle needs to be a visually distinct, rapid-fire vignette showcasing the Family Guy comedic style, Marvel-level action, and a clear, bite-sized educational component about number properties.",
