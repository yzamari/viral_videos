    "reasoning": "The description explicitly uses comic book terminology ('BOOM!', 'KA-POW!', 'SNAP!', 'Kirby Dots', 'speech bubbles', 'thought bubble') and describes a montage of action panels. This style is highly creative and visually dynamic, perfectly suited for Instagram's emphasis on engaging and animated content. A vibrant color palette will enhance the comic book aesthetic and grab attention.",

For Instagram, avoiding the bottom 20% means 'bottom_center' is a safe bet, allowing viewers to see the text clearly while still taking in the main comic visuals.",
