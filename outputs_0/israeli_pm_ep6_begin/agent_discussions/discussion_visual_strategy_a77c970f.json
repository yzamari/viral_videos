      "suggestions": [
        "Utilize distinct visual filters and animation styles for each major emotional shift. For example, the 'WANTED' posters and initial rise could use a gritty, ink-heavy comic style, while the 'Depression spiral' employs distorted perspectives and glitch effects, mirroring Thor's breakdown. The 'Wakanda-style' meeting should incorporate vibrant, abstract geometric patterns overlaid on historical footage for a unique visual fusion.",
        "Implement a strong, evolving audio landscape to guide the narrative. Begin with an empowering, anthemic score that shifts dramatically to chaotic, dissonant sounds during the 'Lebanon War Chaos' and 'Depression Spiral' sequences, underscoring the psychological breakdown. The 'Cave Hermit' segment should feature stark silence or a low, guttural hum, amplifying the isolation and despair before the unnerving ambient track for the post-credit scene."

        "Utilize bold, high-contrast comic art styles for each section, with clear, stylized text for thought bubbles and captions to ensure readability and aesthetic cohesion.
