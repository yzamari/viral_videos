  "mission_statement": "EPISODE 9: Finding Dragon Treasures!! Show this as HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects! Create a Family Guy style comedy where dragon treasure hunter teaches extreme value theorem, uniform continuity, and introduces derivatives. Cover finding max/min on closed intervals, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor theorem, and derivative as instantaneous rate of change. Use visual metaphors: treasure hunting, dragon velocity, measuring slopes. Show relationship between differentiability and continuity.",
