1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,604
All aboard the SEQUENCE EXPRESS!

2
00:00:01,604 --> 00:00:02,246
Our first

3
00:00:02,246 --> 00:00:03,019
number is one.

4
00:00:03,019 --> 00:00:03,533
Next, one-half.

5
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:04,048
Then, one-third.

6
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:04,437
CHOO CHOO!

7
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:05,407
Notice the pattern - each

8
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:06,732
term follows a simple rule.

9
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:07,262
We are

10
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:08,187
approaching LIMIT STATION, zero.

11
00:00:08,187 --> 00:00:08,881
Convergence means we

12
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:11,568
get increasingly closer to zero.

13
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:12,643
After a

14
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:15,751
certain point, all terms remain extremely
close

15
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:16,737
to zero.

16
00:00:16,737 --> 00:00:19,199
The UNIQUE LIMIT THEOREM guarantees

17
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,707
only one possible destination.

18
00:00:21,707 --> 00:00:23,588
If minus M

19
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:27,585
is less than or equal to a

20
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:31,794
sub n, the sequence is bounded.

21
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:32,496
This

22
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:34,847
convergence is fascinating, is it not?

23
00:00:34,847 --> 00:00:35,239
The

24
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:38,582
elegance of mathematics is on full display

25
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:39,396
here.

26
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:44,277
We see the power of limits

27
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:47,595
in action, approaching the destination
with unwavering

28
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:48,289
precision.

29
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:52,453
The journey itself is as remarkable

30
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:53,483
as the destination.

31
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:54,857
Observe how each step

32
00:00:54,857 --> 00:00:56,137
brings us closer, illustrating the concept
flawlessly.

33
00:00:56,137 --> 00:00:57,051
The precision is truly astounding.

34
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:58,514
It is a beautiful illustration of
mathematical convergence
