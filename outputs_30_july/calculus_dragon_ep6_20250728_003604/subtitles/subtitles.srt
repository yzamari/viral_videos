00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,089
Welcome to Sparky's Power-Up Workshop!

2
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:02,507
Today,

3
00:00:02,807 --> 00:00:03,996
we master exponents.

4
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:05,184
Imagine transforming a

5
00:00:05,484 --> 00:00:12,433
cute dragon into a fiery inferno

6
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:15,580
using fractional powers - it is

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,552
simply dividing the power-up!

8
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:18,388
Real exponents

9
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,959
are like infinite power-ups;

10
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:20,595
we approach

11
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,480
a number using limits.

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,272
See the

13
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:24,500
bubbles grow closer?

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,427
Topology explores these

15
00:00:25,727 --> 00:00:26,005
spaces.

16
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:27,120
Some points stand alone;

17
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,399
others

18
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:28,352
have boundaries.

19
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:29,658
It is all about

20
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:30,959
connections!

21
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:35,966
This is the Cantor set,

22
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:37,170
a fractal masterpiece, a perfect example
of infinity within limits.

23
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,442
Mind blown, humans
