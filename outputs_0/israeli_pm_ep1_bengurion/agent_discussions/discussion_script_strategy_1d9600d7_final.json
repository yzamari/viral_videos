    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Script Structure: Divide the 65 seconds into 8-10 distinct 'panels,' each roughly 6-7 seconds long. Each panel will feature a specific visual (e.g., a comic panel depiction of Ben-Gurion's actions) paired with a core sound effect and 1-2 subtitle sentences. Start with an explosive 'BOOM!' and Ben-Gurion's emergence, culminating in the 'True Believer Achievement' editor's note., Viral Hooks & Engagement: Integrate strong, emotionally resonant sound effects ('BOOM!', 'SNAP!', 'KA-POW!', 'WHOOSH!') and a commanding voiceover for key lines ('I am... INEVITABLE!', 'Finally, peace.'). The montage of actions, humor (yoga), and the 'plot twist' retirement create narrative intrigue. The final teaser and editor's note act as a memorable, shareable 'Easter egg'., Script Structure: Divide the 65 seconds into 8-10 segments (approx. 6-8 seconds each), starting with the 'BOOM!' of Ben-Gurion emerging, followed by the 'SNAP!' of the Mandate vanishing, then a rapid-fire montage of independence declaration (KA-POW!), cabinet yoga (WHOOSH!), kibbutz building (Kirby Dots), the desert cabin 'peace' moment, and finally the teaser and editor's note. Ensure seamless, almost jarring transitions between panels.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Timing Precision: The most significant concern is maintaining the aggressive 6-8 second per panel pacing while ensuring clarity and impact. Each transition must be instantaneous to avoid losing viewer attention on Instagram. Overly long explanations or complex visuals within a panel will derail the mission.",
      "Tone Consistency: Balancing the epic scope of nation-building with the darkly humorous, over-the-top Marvel style requires careful execution. The tone must remain consistent to avoid alienating viewers or diminishing the intended impact of the 'achievement'.",
      "The primary concern is maintaining visual clarity and narrative coherence across numerous rapid-fire comic panels within the tight 65-second duration. Overly complex visuals or sound mixing could lead to confusion, diminishing the impact of Ben-Gurion's story and the 'achievement' message. Meticulous editing and precise timing of audio-visual elements are critical.",
      "The primary concern is maintaining absolute audio-visual synchronization across all panels. Any lag or misalignment between a sound effect, voiceover, and visual cue will break the immersive comic-book illusion and reduce impact. Precise timing of each 5-7 second segment is critical to avoid feeling rushed or incomplete."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "For viral optimization, incorporate a 'challenge' or 'easter egg' element within the final panel, such as the 'Ben-Gurion will return... in 1955!' teaser and the 'True Believer Achievement' editor's note. This encourages rewatches and comments as viewers try to decipher the callbacks and references.",
      "Viral Hooks & Engagement: Utilize the 'I am... INEVITABLE!' line as a primary audio hook. The 'Kirby Dots' energy for kibbutz building and the unexpected yoga headstand during a cabinet meeting serve as visually quirky and unexpected elements designed for shares and commentary. The 'True Believer Achievement' editor's note is the ultimate call-to-action and humorous punchline, encouraging rewatches.",
      "Segment the 65 seconds into approximately 10-12 distinct visual/audio 'panels,' allocating 5-7 seconds per panel, including transitions. Each panel must feature a strong visual, a corresponding sound effect (BOOM, SNAP, KA-POW, WHOOSH, Kirby Dots), and a 1-2 sentence voiceover, ensuring clarity and rapid information delivery.",
      "Script Structure: Divide the 65 seconds into 8-10 segments (approx. 6-8 seconds each), starting with the 'BOOM!' of Ben-Gurion emerging, followed by the 'SNAP!' of the Mandate vanishing, then a rapid-fire montage of independence declaration (KA-POW!), cabinet yoga (WHOOSH!), kibbutz building (Kirby Dots), the desert cabin 'peace' moment, and finally the teaser and editor's note.
