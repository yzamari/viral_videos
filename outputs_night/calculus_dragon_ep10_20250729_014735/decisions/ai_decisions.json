    "reasoning": "Anime excels at creating dynamic, energetic visuals that can effectively translate complex concepts like calculus into exciting Olympic events. The 'epic effects' requested for the title card, coupled with visual metaphors like relay races and treasure hunting, align perfectly with the expressive and often over-the-top nature of anime. A vibrant color palette will further enhance the energetic and celebratory Olympic theme, appealing to a broad, general audience on Instagram.",

For Instagram, placing this prominent title card at the top center will ensure it's easily visible without obstructing the main visual content, especially as the video progresses into the calculus-themed Olympic events. This position also allows the title card to be a strong opening statement.",
