    "reasoning": "The prompt explicitly mentions 'INSANE Family Guy parody,' which is a strong indicator for a cartoon style. The descriptions of 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD,' 'epic effects,' 'ridiculous chase scenes,' and 'train EXPLOSIONS' all lend themselves well to a vibrant, exaggerated cartoon aesthetic. This style is highly engaging for a general audience on Instagram and allows for the fantastical elements like a dragon conductor, magical trains, and mathematical obstacles to be depicted in a fun and accessible way. Vibrant colors will further enhance the energetic and comedic tone.",

    "reasoning": "The request specifies a 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects'. Placing this prominently at the top center ensures maximum impact and visibility for the title, fitting the 'huge' and 'epic' descriptions. It also avoids the bottom 20% of the screen as per Instagram guidelines.",
