[VISUAL: Baby dragon Sparky in a 'Power-Up Workshop' surrounded by levers and gears] DIALOGUE: Welcome to Sparky's Power-Up Workshop! Today, we master exponents, like turning a cute dragon into a fiery inferno! [VISUAL: Sparky demonstrates fractional powers with glowing orbs, a dragon gathering forms] DIALOGUE: Fractional powers? Imagine sharing a single dragon's might. It is just dividing the power-up! Simple, right? [VISUAL: Sparky shows real exponents using a 'limit' slider and expanding bubble zones] DIALOGUE: Real exponents are like infinite power-ups. We approach a number using limits. See the bubbles grow closer? [VISUAL: Sparky points to distinct points (isolated) and areas without boundaries (open/closed sets) with fractal magic swirls] DIALOGUE: Topology explores spaces. Some points are all alone, while others have boundaries. It is all about connections! [VISUAL: Sparky reveals a simplified Cantor set visualization with a 'magic' flourish] DIALOGUE: This is the Cantor set, a fractal masterpiece. It is a perfect example of infinity within limits. Mind blown, humans!
