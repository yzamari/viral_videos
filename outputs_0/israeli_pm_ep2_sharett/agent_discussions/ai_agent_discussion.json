Is it 1955 already? The air crackles with unspoken tensions. Who is the Prime Minister now? The question hangs heavy, unanswered.  A sense of uncertainty pervades the room, thick and suffocating. The weight of decisions rests heavily on their shoulders. The future of the nation hangs in the balance.  Each move is fraught with consequence.  The clock ticks relentlessly, marking the passage of time and the urgency of the moment.  A silent prayer escapes Sharett's lips, a plea for wisdom and strength.
