    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Implement exaggerated sound effects for the 'Peter Griffin-style warriors' fighting, including grunts, impacts, and the distinct 'WITNESS ME!' shout with heavy reverb. For the Brian character, a subtle, thoughtful ambient sound that's abruptly cut off by the water truck's impact will enhance the joke., Ensure Maryam's dialogue has a clear progression of distress, culminating in a spoken line delivered with a mix of resignation and absurdity. The final Persian title card should have a somber, atmospheric sound bed, perhaps with a dripping water sound effect, to tie into the 'thirsty' theme., Segment timing is crucial: Allocate no more than 5-8 seconds for each of the main comedic beats (Maryam's intro, Peter-style warriors, Brian-style dog, Maryam's final line, chicken fight) to maintain momentum and fit within the target duration.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is maintaining a brisk pace without feeling rushed, ensuring each joke and visual gag has enough time to register with the audience. Overly long segments will break the comedic flow.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the audio transitions between the main narrative and the cutaways are seamless and timed to perfection, preventing any lag that could disrupt the comedic flow or the audience's immersion. Also, any music bed used should be dynamic enough to shift tone with the comedic beats.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the numerous short, rapid segments and dialogue lines are precisely timed to fit within the 60-second \u00b15% window without feeling rushed or losing comedic impact."
