The key is to ensure every second of the 'Unknown Duration' is packed with visual gags, rapid cuts, and clear, humorous explanations of mathematical concepts. The opening animated title card is crucial for setting this tone and immediately signals the video's unique blend of chaos and education, a strong hook for the platform's algorithm.",
