The core comedic hook lies in the stark contrast between the fantastical unicorns and the geopolitical conflict.",

The comedic power lies in crafting distinct, natural voices that grapple with the sheer absurdity of the situation, making the fantastical feel grounded through their authentic, albeit bizarre, responses.",

We need to maximize information density by having visual gags reinforce character reactions, ensuring no moment is wasted in conveying the comedic contrast.",
