SMOKE PANEL! Golda emerges, a cigarette glowing fiercely.  She commands, her voice gravelly: "I am the only man in the cabinet!" TRANSFORMATION! Cabinet members shrink to toddlers, their debates childish cries. Action explodes: Yom Kippur War! Coffee pot in one hand, tank radio in the other. KABOOM! SNAP! Intelligence failure! Crucial files scatter; warnings ignored. TIME REWIND: Ignored warnings flash. Kitchen diplomacy begins. World leaders shrink before her. Resignation! A mushroom cloud billows.  The internet ignites. "There is no Palestine!" POW! Digital firestorm.
