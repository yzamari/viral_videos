The baby dragon's exaggerated reactions to abstract ideas like infinite stairs and time loops will be the primary driver of humor and relatability, ensuring the content is digestible and shareable.",

We need punchy sound effects and character-appropriate vocalizations that punctuate each mathematical explanation, making the abstract tangible and funny.",
