    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Utilize 'VEO-2' capabilities for rapid scene generation, ensuring each panel feels distinct and visually striking, mirroring a comic book layout., Implement a consistent visual theme with bold lines and dramatic shading, amplifying the 'Marvel Comics' aesthetic for all panels, including the 'discomfort lines' during the handshake and the 'black ooze' for dissent., Incorporate on-screen text overlays with classic comic book fonts for key phrases like 'ICE THAW PANEL!' and 'TRAITOR!', enhancing the thematic consistency and readability.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is balancing the inherent gravity of the assassination narrative with the 'Marvel Comics return' visual style to avoid trivializing the event while still maintaining audience engagement on Instagram. Overly cartoonish sound effects could detract from the historical weight.",
      "Ensuring the sensitive historical content is treated with appropriate gravity while still embracing the 'Marvel Comics' aesthetic requires careful sonic calibration; avoiding an overly cartoonish approach during the assassination is key.",
      "Ensuring the visual representation of 'discomfort lines visible' during the handshake is clear without being overly literal or distracting.",
      "Ensuring the delicate balance between the comic book aesthetic and the gravity of the historical events is crucial. Overly stylized visuals could trivialize the assassination, and conversely, too much realism might clash with the 'Marvel Comics return' framing. The technical approach must carefully blend these elements.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the dramatic comic book style with the sensitive historical context of the assassination, ensuring it is impactful without being gratuitous or disrespectful.",
      "Ensuring seamless transitions between contrasting moods \u2013 from optimism to chaos to tragedy \u2013 will be technically challenging within the short duration, requiring careful editing and sound design.",
      "Maintaining visual clarity and narrative coherence across rapid panel changes on a mobile-first platform like Instagram, especially with layered audio cues, is crucial."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "For the 'TRAITOR!' chants and 'BLACK OOZE,' implement a 'comic panel' visual effect where the text visually spreads or contaminates the screen, amplified by layered, distorted audio for a symbiote-like effect. This directly addresses the 'symbiote' description and enhances engagement.",
      "The assassination sequence requires distinct, sharp 'BANG!' SFX, followed by a momentary sonic void or a fading 'shield fall' sound to punctuate the tragedy and align with the 'noir' feel.",
      "Utilize aggressive pacing and quick cuts between panels, with distinct visual treatments for each narrative beat \u2013 perhaps more vibrant for peace, muted and chaotic for dissent, and high-contrast noir for the assassination to maximize Instagram engagement.",
      "Emphasize the 'CLANG! BANG!' and 'TRAITOR!' chants with layered, slightly distorted SFX and echoing vocals to capture the 'symbiote' spread, building sonic tension before the assassination.",
      "Maintain a tight pacing throughout, allocating roughly 3-5 seconds per key event to fit the 65-second target, with the assassination sequence being a focal point with potentially slightly longer duration.",
      "Incorporate on-screen text overlays with classic comic book fonts for key phrases like 'ICE THAW PANEL!' and 'TRAITOR!', enhancing the thematic consistency and readability.",
      "Implement a consistent visual theme with bold lines and dramatic shading, amplifying the 'Marvel Comics' aesthetic for all panels, including the 'discomfort lines' during the handshake and the 'black ooze' for dissent.",
      "Employ a visual split effect for the 'Nation SPLITS down middle!' panel and a somber, static shot for the 'Empty suit ceremony panel' to drive home the tragic conclusion.",
      "Implement a dynamic soundscape with distinct audio cues for each panel: optimistic swells for peace efforts, cacophony for 'TRAITOR!' chants with a 'symbiote' spread effect, and sharp, impactful 'BANG!' sounds for the assassination, followed by a stark silence or fading 'shield fall' effect.",
      "Employ a split-screen effect or rapid cross-dissolves to visually represent the 'Nation SPLITS down middle!'.",
      "Overlay bold, comic-style text for key phrases like 'PEACE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!' and 'TRAITOR!' to enhance visual appeal and reinforce the Marvel theme, ensuring readability on mobile screens.",
      "The 'HISTORIC HANDSHAKE' should be underscored with a subtle, tense musical sting, highlighting the visible 'discomfort lines,' while the 'Nation SPLITS' needs an impactful sonic and visual severance.",
      "The 'ASSASSINATION NOIR' sequence should feature a deliberate slow-motion effect on the shield falling after the three sharp 'BANG!' sounds, creating a visually arresting and memorable moment that drives home the tragedy. This emphasizes the 'noir' aspect and adds gravitas.",
      "Utilize distinct visual filters or animation styles for contrasting panels: bright, hopeful colors for the 'PEACE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!' and Oslo Accords, transitioning to stark, gritty noir for the assassination. This visual shift will immediately signal changes in tone and pace.",
      "Consider a visual metaphor for the 'BLACK OOZE' spreading, perhaps a subtle glitch effect or a growing ink stain animation across panels.",
      "For the 'ASSASSINATION NOIR' sequence, use a dramatic shift to black and white with selective color accents on key elements like the falling shield, accompanied by sharp, impactful sound design.",
      "Precisely time the 'ASSASSINATION NOIR' sequence with three sharp 'BANG!' sounds and a visual of the falling shield, followed by a moment of profound silence, to maximize its dramatic impact.",
      "Use dynamic text overlays in a comic-book font for phrases like 'PEACE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!' and 'TRAITOR!' to enhance the Marvel feel and readability.",
      "Utilize 'VEO-2' capabilities for rapid scene generation, ensuring each panel feels distinct and visually striking, mirroring a comic book layout."
