The delivery should be rapid-fire but articulated, with distinct vocal inflections for each function concept to prevent auditory monotony.",
        "Audio Approach: Aim for a total spoken word count that, when delivered at a brisk but understandable pace (around 150-160 words per minute), fits within the 37 seconds remaining after the title card. Each function explanation should occupy roughly 3-4 seconds of audio, including setup and punchline.",
        "Sound Design: Beyond the epic title card sound, sprinkle in subtle, comedic sound effects that punctuate the dragon's explanations. A 'poof' for transformations, a 'swish' for territory mapping, or a 'boing' for function composition can add a layer of polish and humor without cluttering the audio.",
        "Audio Duration Compliance: The script must be meticulously timed. Read through each line with the intended pace and vocal style. If a segment runs long, condense the dialogue further or slightly speed up the delivery. If too short, add a brief comedic aside or emphasize a visual element with a sound cue."
