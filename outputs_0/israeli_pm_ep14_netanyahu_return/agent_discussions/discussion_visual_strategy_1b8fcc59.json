For the 'Corruption trial' segment, incorporate subtle clinking of coins or champagne glasses alongside a slightly sinister chuckle to highlight the 'scandal stones'., Allocate roughly 8 seconds per key 'panel' or narrative beat to hit the 65-second target, allowing for quick transitions and minimal dead air.",
