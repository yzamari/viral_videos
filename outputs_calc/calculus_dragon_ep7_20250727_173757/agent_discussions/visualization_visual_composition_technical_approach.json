The core strategy is to translate abstract mathematical functions and their properties into concrete, engaging transformations of a baby dragon, mirroring the provided 'family guy animation' visual style.  Each segment will focus on a specific function concept, using rapid-fire visuals and concise, relatable explanations to maximize comprehension and retention on the platform.",

Each core function concept (rule, domain, range, one-to-one, onto, composition, even/odd/periodic/limits) will be a distinct, approximately 8-second segment. The baby dragon's transformations will be the visual metaphor for each concept, synchronized with rapid-fire narration and on-screen text for key terms and simple equations. This strategy ensures maximum engagement and comprehension by making abstract mathematical ideas concrete, relatable, and entertaining for the Instagram audience.",

Each concept (function rule, domain, range, one-to-one, onto, composition, and even/odd/periodic/limits) will be allocated approximately 8-9 seconds, ensuring precise synchronization between rapid-fire, energetic narration and the dragon's visual transformations.  On-screen text overlays of key terms and simple equations will reinforce comprehension, making abstract mathematical ideas tangible and memorable, thus effectively teaching the core concepts.",
