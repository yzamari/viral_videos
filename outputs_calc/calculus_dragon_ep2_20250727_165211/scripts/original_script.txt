All aboard the SEQUENCE EXPRESS! Our first car is a₁=1, then a₂=1/2, a₃=1/3. CHOO CHOO! Watch the pattern – each term follows a rule! We are heading toward LIMIT STATION, which is at L=0. CONVERGENCE means we get closer and closer to L! After some point N, all terms stay within epsilon of L! The UNIQUE LIMIT THEOREM says only one destination is possible! If minus M is less than or equal to a sub n, we are bounded!
