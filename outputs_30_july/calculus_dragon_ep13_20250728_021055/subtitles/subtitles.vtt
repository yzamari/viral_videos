00:00.000 --> 00:02.194
This case is a complete mess!

00:02.494 --> 00:05.942
My dragon senses pinpoint a function

00:06.242 --> 00:07.000
needing analysis.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.515
We first establish its

00:08.815 --> 00:09.050
domain:

00:09.050 --> 00:09.991
where it can roam.

00:09.991 --> 00:10.226
Next,

00:10.526 --> 00:14.418
identify critical points â€“ potential ups

00:14.718 --> 00:16.346
and downs.

00:16.346 --> 00:19.603
The first derivative reveals

00:19.903 --> 00:24.004
its mood swings, showing increases and

00:24.304 --> 00:24.818
decreases.

00:24.818 --> 00:27.387
The second derivative indicates concavity,

00:27.687 --> 00:29.898
the curve's emotional state.

00:29.898 --> 00:31.004
We seek

00:31.304 --> 00:33.028
asymptotes, the function's boundaries.

00:33.028 --> 00:33.890
Inflection points

00:34.190 --> 00:35.131
mark significant attitude shifts.

00:35.131 --> 00:35.601
Finally, we

00:35.901 --> 00:36.590
sketch the complete picture.

00:36.590 --> 00:36.935
Case closed:

00:36.935 --> 00:37.625
another function's mystery solved
