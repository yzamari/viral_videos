00:00.000 --> 00:03.096
Behold Ehud Barak, Israel's most decorated
soldier.

00:03.096 --> 00:05.174
His medals shone, a dazzling display.

00:05.174 --> 00:05.520
They

00:05.520 --> 00:08.112
called him Israel's most brilliant Prime
Minister.

00:08.112 --> 00:09.031
His intellect was renowned.

00:09.031 --> 00:09.720
At Camp David,

00:09.720 --> 00:13.632
he proposed a peace deal, a bold

00:13.632 --> 00:14.078
initiative.

00:14.078 --> 00:16.752
Yet, Yasser Arafat rejected his every

00:16.752 --> 00:17.198
proposal.

00:17.198 --> 00:19.872
The Second Intifada erupted, a devastating

00:19.872 --> 00:20.606
conflict.

00:20.606 --> 00:25.008
Barak, a man of many facets,

00:25.008 --> 00:28.224
once undertook a clandestine operation in
disguise.

00:28.224 --> 00:32.064
He demonstrated a remarkable understanding
of gender

00:32.064 --> 00:32.270
fluidity.

00:32.270 --> 00:33.504
His coalition government fractured, a
swift

00:33.504 --> 00:34.666
and tragic collapse.

00:34.666 --> 00:35.829
Victory eluded him;

00:35.829 --> 00:36.216
he

00:36.216 --> 00:37.584
suffered a crushing defeat to Ariel
Sharon.

00:37.584 --> 00:40.790
It was a historic loss.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.072
Later, on

00:42.072 --> 00:43.385
Epstein's island, he famously quipped, "I
kept my underwear on!

00:43.385 --> 00:44.304
" Now, he reflects on his legacy.
