Each visual gag, from the exploding org chart to the multiplying buildings, must be punchy, amplified by exaggerated sound design, and timed to land precisely within the 40-second window, culminating in the universally understood 'This is fine' meme for maximum shareability.",

Prioritizing rapid pacing and clear audio cues for the 'exploding org chart,' 'COMMITTEE COUNT: \u221e' ticker, and the 'Chairman of Nothing' interview will enhance the satirical impact within the 40-second timeframe.",
