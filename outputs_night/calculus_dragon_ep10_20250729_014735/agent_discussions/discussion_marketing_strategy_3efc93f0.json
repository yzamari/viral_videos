For Inverse Function Derivatives, depict a dragon navigating a complex obstacle course that's the inverse of a previous course it conquered.",
        "Higher Derivatives can be a dragon performing increasingly complex aerial maneuvers, each layer of complexity representing a higher derivative. Critical points can be visualized as a dragon reaching the peak of a mountain for a treasure hunt, with Fermat's/Rolle's theorems as rules for this hunt."
