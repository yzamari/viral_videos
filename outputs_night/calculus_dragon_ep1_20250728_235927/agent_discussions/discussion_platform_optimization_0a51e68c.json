The proposed content's blend of comedy, memorable characters, and rapid visual shifts aligns perfectly with this. The unknown duration allows for flexibility, but prioritizing watch time through strong storytelling is key.",

Integrate witty, educational jokes that are both funny and informative, making the learning process enjoyable and shareable, boosting viral potential."

      "concerns": [
        "The 'Unknown Duration' is a significant concern for Instagram's algorithm, which often favors shorter, more digestible content. The video needs a clear narrative arc and compelling content throughout its entire length to maintain audience retention, or it risks being prematurely dropped."
