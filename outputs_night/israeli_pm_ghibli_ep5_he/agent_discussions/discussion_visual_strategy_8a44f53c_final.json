    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Emphasize the visual metamorphosis of Rabin's uniform and the battlefield elements, utilizing subtle Ghibli-inspired magical realism.  The transition of swords into olives and the handshake into a light bridge must be executed with a smooth, almost magical flow., Prioritize capturing Rabin's 'eyes full of pain and compassion' through close-ups and subtle animation, coupled with a poignant, instrumental peace anthem that swells at key moments like the signing of the Oslo Accords and the handshake., Emphasize the visual transformation of Rabin's uniform and the battlefield with fluid animation, using soft, dreamlike lighting to capture the Ghibli style. Ensure the sound design complements these visual cues, with subtle rustling for the uniform change and a gentle 'shimmer' as swords become olives.",
