This approach directly addresses the need for engagement on Instagram by offering novelty and entertainment.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Utilize the animated title card as a strong visual hook. Immediately follow with the dragon pilot attempting a 'smooth' flight, which is interrupted by a discontinuity, setting up the comedic and educational premise.",

The dragon pilot needs to land within this tiny 'epsilon' zone, ensuring the flight path (function value) is consistently 'close' (delta) to the target altitude. If the dragon teleports or veers wildly, it's a discontinuity."

The key is to ensure every explanation, from epsilon-delta to the Intermediate Value Theorem, is driven by a funny, relatable dragon flight scenario that viewers will immediately want to share.",

Instagram's algorithm favors engaging, shareable content, and this concept has high potential for both if executed with comedic timing and clear visual metaphors.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Use rapid-fire visual gags and quick cuts between the dragon pilot explaining concepts and absurd flight scenarios, mimicking Family Guy's pacing. For the epsilon-delta definition, show the dragon trying to land perfectly within a tiny 'epsilon' target zone, but keep missing comically. For continuity, demonstrate a smooth flight path versus a jagged, teleporting one.",
        "The animated title card needs to be bombastic and set a high-energy tone immediately. For the Cauchy criterion, visualize the dragon's flight path getting arbitrarily close to a desired landing spot from both sides, emphasizing the 'arbitrarily close' aspect through precise, yet funny, maneuvering. For discontinuities, illustrate a sudden, unexpected drop in altitude or a mid-air 'teleport' that would be a crash in real flying."

      "concerns": [
        "The biggest concern is balancing the humor with accurate (even if simplified) mathematical explanations. If the comedy overshadows the learning or the math becomes too muddled, it might alienate the educational audience and not be funny enough for the general audience."

        "Continuity conditions can be shown by the dragon's flight path needing to be a single, unbroken line; a 'jump' in altitude or direction would be a discontinuity, like abruptly teleporting instead of smoothly ascending.",
        "Types of discontinuities can be visualized as: removable (a tiny, easily fixed wobble), jump (sudden altitude shift), or infinite (the dragon flying erratically upwards and never coming back down).",
        "The Intermediate Value Theorem can be demonstrated by showing the dragon needing to reach a specific altitude (e.g., to pick up a passenger) and proving it must have passed through all intermediate altitudes in between its starting and ending points.",
