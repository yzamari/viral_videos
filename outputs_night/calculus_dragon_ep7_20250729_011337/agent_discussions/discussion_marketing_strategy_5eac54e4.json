      "suggestions": [
        "Develop a character arc for the baby dragon that mirrors a learning curve, making the explanations relatable and funny. For transformation rules, visualize a 'Dragon Transformation Machine' where inputs go in, and different dragon forms (outputs) come out, emphasizing the rules of this machine.",
        "For domain and range, use 'territory maps' showing the valid dragon forms the baby can transform into and the possible transformations it can perform. For one-to-one and onto, utilize character interactions: if each input transformation leads to a unique output dragon form and all possible dragon forms are covered, it's a bijection."

The animated title card sets an immediate tone, but subsequent segment pacing is crucial. Each function explanation needs a distinct, comical dragon transformation tied to its definition and a relatable visual metaphor to ensure memorability and shareability, especially for abstract concepts like domain and range.  The goal is to make learning functions as entertaining as watching a sketch.",

Applying this to complex math concepts like functions requires tight, visually-driven explanations that are both funny and educational, leveraging the proposed metaphors to make abstract ideas concrete and easily digestible for Instagram's fast-paced consumption.",

        "For 'transformation rules,' show the baby dragon struggling to transform into a specific shape (e.g., a square), with the 'rule' being the constraint on its transformation, visually represented by limitations in the 'dragon transformation machine.'",
        "For 'domain and range,' visualize these as 'territory maps' for the dragon. The domain is the area the dragon can enter, and the range is the area it can transform into.",
        "For 'one-to-one functions,' depict a scenario where each input (e.g., a specific food item) results in a unique dragon output (e.g., a specific color of fire).",
        "For 'onto functions,' ensure every possible dragon form (output) can be achieved by some input (e.g., every type of food).",
        "For 'bijections,' combine the one-to-one and onto concepts, showing a perfect mapping between food items and dragon forms.",
        "For 'function composition,' illustrate the dragon performing one transformation after another, like eating a spicy pepper to gain fiery breath, then swallowing a cloud to become fluffy.",
        "For 'even functions,' use a 'mirror symmetry' visual where the dragon's transformation on one side of a central axis is perfectly mirrored on the other.",
        "For 'odd functions,' utilize 'rotational symmetry,' where transforming the dragon by 180 degrees results in an opposite but equivalent transformation.",
        "For 'periodic functions,' show the dragon repeating its transformations in a regular, cyclical pattern, perhaps tied to its feeding schedule.",
        "Ensure the 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD' is impactful and visually represents the 'Function Dragon Transform!!' theme with dynamic effects and sound.",
        "Break down each function into its own short, punchy segment (under 15 seconds each) with clear, concise dialogue and subtitle overlays.",
        "End each segment with a call to action, like 'What function should Rusty teach next?' or a quick poll in Stories to drive engagement."
