The animated title card needs to be visually stunning to immediately capture attention within the first 3 seconds, setting the tone for a Family Guy-esque experience. We should structure the narrative to ensure each mathematical concept is explained visually and humorously, maintaining viewer interest throughout the unknown duration.",

        "Structure the video with rapid-fire jokes tied to each mathematician and concept; for example, Dragon struggling with a specific mathematician's formula or making a quip about their era's fashion. Integrate the 'e' powered time machine concept visually in every transition, perhaps showing the dragon literally stepping through 'nested intervals' that look like glowing portals.",
