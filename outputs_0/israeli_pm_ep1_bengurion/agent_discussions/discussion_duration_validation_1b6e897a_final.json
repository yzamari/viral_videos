    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate approximately 5-7 seconds per action panel montage, using aggressive 'comic book style' sound effects like 'BOOM!', 'SNAP!', and 'KA-POW!' to punctuate each visual transition and convey rapid action. Ensure voiceovers for key phrases like 'I am... INEVITABLE!' are sharp and impactful., For the 'WHOOSH!' yoga headstand segment, utilize dynamic motion graphics with subtle whooshing sound effects and a brief, focused moment of dialogue to emphasize concentration amidst chaos. This allows for a brief pause in the high-octane action while still conveying character and activity., Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds per major action panel described in the mission (e.g., 'BOOM! David Ben-Gurion bursts from desert sands,' 'SNAP! British Mandate vanishes,' 'KA-POW! Declaring independence,' 'WHOOSH! Yoga headstands'). This provides a framework for precise timing.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting all the described elements into the 61.75-68.25 second window without feeling rushed or sacrificing clarity. Each panel's visual and auditory cues need to be impactful yet brief.",
      "Ensuring the 'sweat drops' visual for others declaring independence is clear and quick enough to contrast with Ben-Gurion's confident action, without needing extended dialogue or animation.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring that the rapid pacing of the 'Marvel Comics opening' does not lead to information overload or a loss of clarity for the audience, especially on a platform like Instagram where attention spans can be short. Precise timing and clear, concise dialogue are critical to avoid this.",
      "The primary concern is maintaining the exact timing for each of the 8 segments within the 65-second target (\u00b15%), requiring precise coordination between visual cuts, sound design, and on-screen text delivery to avoid temporal drift."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Utilize dynamic transitions and motion graphics that mirror comic book styles (e.g., 'Kirby Dots energy') to visually bridge segments and maintain momentum without adding significant time.",
      "Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds per major action panel described in the mission (e.g., 'BOOM! David Ben-Gurion bursts from desert sands,' 'SNAP! British Mandate vanishes,' 'KA-POW! Declaring independence,' 'WHOOSH! Yoga headstands'). This provides a framework for precise timing.",
      "Integrate minimal, punchy on-screen text for dialogue and descriptions, limiting each panel's text to one sentence to maximize readability and adhere to the 1-2 sentence script requirement per segment.",
      "Allocate 6-10 seconds per panel for visual impact and dialogue, ensuring the 'BOOM!', 'SNAP!', 'KA-POW!', and 'WHOOSH!' sound effects are perfectly timed with panel transitions and key actions.",
      "Condense dialogue for each panel to a maximum of 1-2 short sentences, ensuring they are readable as subtitles and delivered quickly. For instance, 'I am... INEVITABLE!' needs mere seconds, while 'Finally, peace.' should be a brief visual pause.",
      "Integrate on-screen text for the 'Editor's note box' and 'Ben-Gurion will return... in 1955!' to avoid consuming valuable audio time and ensure clarity.",
      "For the 'WHOOSH!' yoga headstand segment, utilize dynamic motion graphics with subtle whooshing sound effects and a brief, focused moment of dialogue to emphasize concentration amidst chaos. This allows for a brief pause in the high-octane action while still conveying character and activity.",
