    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Script Structure: Allocate time per panel, starting with the '6 DAYS!' countdown (8s), followed by generals' urgency (7s), Eshkol's dilemma (10s), the 'Table Smash' transformation (5s), victory montage (15s), the meme panel (3s), the 'death panel' (7s), and finally the teaser (5s), totaling approximately 60 seconds, allowing buffer for transitions and sound effects., Viral Hooks: The 'Spider-Man pointing' meme panel injects humor and relatability, making the content shareable. The dramatic transformation and victory montage tap into themes of heroism and success, creating an emotional hook., Engagement Strategy: Use bold, graphic visuals with clear, concise subtitles. Employ a driving, cinematic score that escalates with the narrative tension.
