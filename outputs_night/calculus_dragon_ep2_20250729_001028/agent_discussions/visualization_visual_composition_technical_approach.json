The Family Guy style should translate into sharp character animation, exaggerated reactions, and witty dialogue that simplifies complex ideas like convergence and the squeeze theorem.",

Each segment needs to be a tightly choreographed gag and explanation, leveraging the Family Guy style for exaggerated characters and reactions to drive home the concepts of convergence, boundedness, and the squeeze theorem.",

          "message": "For 'Sequence Dragon Express' on Instagram, the audio design needs to complement the 'Family Guy' comedy and the 'epic effects' for the title card, ensuring the train sounds and character voices are distinct yet harmonized. The core of the video's success hinges on perfectly syncing the humorous dialogue and visual gags with the mathematical explanations, making the train metaphor truly come alive. The audio should support the rapid pacing required for Instagram, with clear, punchy sound bites and exaggerated effects to punctuate jokes and concepts.",
