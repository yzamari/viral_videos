    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Opening with a quick, punchy delivery by Maryam, followed by immediate, dynamic animation of the water droplets fleeing with suitcases, will capture attention within the first 10-15 seconds., The cutaway to the oblivious government official should be timed for maximum comedic contrast, with his dismissive line landing precisely after the visual of the fleeing water, emphasizing the disconnect between authorities and reality., For viral optimization, begin with a bold, attention-grabbing visual of the Iran International logo followed immediately by Maryam's exaggerated, rapid-fire delivery of the 'breaking news' to hook viewers instantly.  The visual of water droplets with suitcases should be animated with a frantic, almost cartoonish urgency.",
    "key_considerations": [

      "To enhance persuasion, the cutaway to the oblivious government official should be jarringly quick, emphasizing the disconnect between the problem and the perceived response. The final scene of citizens licking dew off cars will evoke empathy and a sense of urgency through stark visual contrast, driving home the severity of the situation in a darkly humorous way.",
      "Ensure Maryam's voiceover is fast-paced and slightly frantic, with exaggerated Persian inflections, delivered over a quick sequence of the Iran International logo and her introduction, setting an urgent, comedic tone.",

Never heard of her.' line should be delivered with maximum comedic obliviousness and a distinct vocal fry. The final segment of citizens licking dew must be visually jarring, emphasizing the desperation, before the Persian subtitle appears prominently and the video cuts abruptly to black.",
      "The cutaway to the oblivious government official should be timed for maximum comedic contrast, with his dismissive line landing precisely after the visual of the fleeing water, emphasizing the disconnect between authorities and reality.",
