        "Voice Strategy: The 'First they ignore you...' thought bubble should be delivered with a determined, resilient voice, transitioning to a more desperate, fragmented tone for the 'Thor-like breakdown' sequence.

The post-credit map sequence requires an unnerving, low hum that subtly escalates in intensity.",
        "Sound Design Tactics: Implement sharp, impactful sound effects for visual transitions (e.g., the 'FLUTTER!' of doves with distinct pyramid/star wing sounds). The 'Lebanon War Chaos' needs aggressive, glitchy sound design, perhaps incorporating distorted news broadcasts. The 'Nobel Prize MELTS' effect should be a visceral, gooey, dissolving sound, and the 'symbiote' map needs a subtle, creeping synth pad that builds unease.",
        "Pacing Synchronization: Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds for each major visual beat (e.g., WANTED posters, Camp David, Peace Signing), allowing 1-2 seconds for swift transitions.

        "The 'Lebanon War Chaos' and 'Depression Spiral' (approx. 20-25 seconds) require a drastic audio shift: distorted, overlapping sound effects (explosions, static, mechanical failures) and a more frantic, possibly strained vocal delivery, mimicking internal breakdown. The 'Nobel Prize MELTS' needs a visceral, 'dripping' or 'burning' sound effect.",
        "The 'Cave Hermit' section (approx. 5 seconds) demands an extreme audio contrast \u2013 near silence punctuated by a deep, world-weary voice for the caption: 'From terrorist to peacemaker to...'. This isolation must be palpable through audio.",
        "The post-credit map segment (approx. 5-7 seconds) will feature a subtle, creeping ambient track that gradually intensifies with a low, unsettling hum or pulse, mirroring the visual 'spreading like symbiote' and leaving the audience with a chilling, lasting impression.
