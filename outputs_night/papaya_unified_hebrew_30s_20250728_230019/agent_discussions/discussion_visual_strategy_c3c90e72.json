Follow with a swift transition to whimsical Ghibli sounds and a gentle, warm voice for Grandma, around 6-7 seconds. The 'reality check' should have a sudden, comical deflation of sound, lasting about 3 seconds. The night scene needs to explode with energetic party music and clear, crisp sound for the dialogue, especially the drunk guy's line, which should be timed for maximum comedic effect, about 12-15 seconds., The catchiest Hebrew slogan should be delivered with confidence and a slight echo effect, and the business information needs clear, concise audio delivery at the very end, perhaps with a quick sting., Allocate approximately 4-6 seconds for the Marvel-style hero entrance and transformation sequence to build hype.",

Maximizing visual storytelling within 32 seconds is critical for capturing attention on the platform.",
      "suggestions": [
        "For the Marvel intro, utilize aggressive camera movements and sound effects for approximately 4 seconds to establish the 'hero' persona, immediately cutting to a soft, warm Ghibli-esque transition with floating papayas and a gentle voice for Grandma (6-7 seconds). The 'reality check' needs a sharp visual and auditory cut (3 seconds), leading into an energetic 10-second party scene with distinct audio for the drunk guy's comedic line.  Conclude with a 2-3 second impactful Hebrew slogan and business info.",
        "Ensure the visual composition for the Ghibli section emphasizes vibrant, saturated colors and soft, flowing animation to contrast sharply with the gritty Marvel style.  The 'reality check' cut should be quick and almost jarring, using a mundane, slightly desaturated look to highlight the transformation.  For the night scene, focus on dynamic lighting and a bustling atmosphere that feels authentic to a popular bar scene."

        "For the Marvel-style entrance, use a powerful, booming sound effect combined with a 'whoosh' as the wall breaks. The Ghibli transformation needs whimsical chimes and a warm, gentle score. The reality cut should be abrupt with a 'record scratch' or deflating sound. The night scene requires an upbeat, catchy electronic track. Crucially, the drunk guy's line needs a slightly distorted or echoey effect to enhance the humor, and the final Hebrew slogan should have a confident, anthemic delivery.",
        "Implement a distinct audio signature for each visual style change. For example, the transition from Marvel to Ghibli could be a quick swell of magical sound. The cut to reality should be a sharp sound design change, perhaps a quick, comical sting. The party scene needs high-energy, modern music that drops slightly for the drunk guy's line, then swells again for the slogan. Ensure the business information at the end is clear and easy to read/hear, possibly with a subtle, memorable sound tag."
