The 'SNAP!' for vanishing tunnels needs a sharp, distinct, and slightly distorted sound, followed by a brief moment of impactful silence before the next visual.  The security barrier explosion requires a classic 'KA-POW!' with a visual echo, and UN speech energy effects should be subtle, building atmospheric power, not distracting from the message.",

The 'Bibi will return!' line needs a strong, resonant vocal effect, fading into the triumphant swell of the Israeli flag waving."
