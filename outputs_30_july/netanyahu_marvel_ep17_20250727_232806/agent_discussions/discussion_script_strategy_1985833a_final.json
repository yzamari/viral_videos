    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Visually represent each action with a distinct, quick cut, like a comic book panel: Netanyahu smashing through walls, opposition turning to smoke, exploding coalition deals, and so on, all timed with exaggerated sound effects like 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!'., Use bold, comic-book-style on-screen text for dialogue and key phrases to enhance readability and reinforce the visual theme, ensuring subtitles are short and punchy (1-2 sentences max per segment)., Structure the script to allocate approximately 3 seconds per distinct action/dialogue snippet to ensure all elements are covered within the 35-second target, emphasizing visual cues like Netanyahu's lightning aura and the 'comic smoke' effect for the vanishing opposition.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Ensuring that the satirical message remains clear amidst the rapid-fire action and sound effects is a key challenge to avoid misinterpretation on a broad platform like Instagram.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the complex sequence of actions (crashing, vanishing, exploding, juggling, building, reform) and distinct sound cues (CRASH, WHOOSH, BOOM, ZAP, THWACK, CRACK, WHAM) can be visually and sonically represented within the 35-second limit without becoming a jumbled mess. Each element requires dedicated audio presence and visual clarity.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the described rapid-fire events and dialogue into the tight 35-second window without making it feel rushed or incoherent, which could detract from the intended comedic and satirical impact.",
      "The sheer density of distinct actions and dialogue within the 35-second timeframe poses a risk of feeling too rushed or cluttered if not executed with extreme precision in pacing and visual transitions."

      "Structure the script to allocate approximately 3 seconds per distinct action/dialogue snippet to ensure all elements are covered within the 35-second target, emphasizing visual cues like Netanyahu's lightning aura and the 'comic smoke' effect for the vanishing opposition.",
      "Implement a layered sound design where Netanyahu's initial crash features a deep, resonating CRASH followed by a sharp, electric WHOOSH as opposition parties vanish.  The 'BOOM!' for coalition deals should be a quick, percussive hit, immediately followed by the frantic 'ZAP!' of texting and the decisive THWACK of energy beams for settlements.",
      "End with a strong, memorable visual and audio punch \u2013 the Israeli flag with lightning bolts and a final impactful sound \u2013 to leave a lasting impression and encourage shares, playing directly into viral optimization for this specific satirical content.",
      "Incorporate rapid crossfades and 'panel cut' transitions between each action: Netanyahu crashing, opposition vanishing, coalition deals exploding, juggling trials via text, settlement beams, judicial reform splits, and the final flag reveal, creating a fast-paced, digestible narrative.",
      "Prioritize aggressive, comic-style sound layering for 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!', synchronizing them perfectly with their visual counterparts to mimic a visceral Marvel comic experience, crucial for Instagram's sensory engagement.",
      "Use bold, comic-book-style on-screen text for dialogue and key phrases to enhance readability and reinforce the visual theme, ensuring subtitles are short and punchy (1-2 sentences max per segment).",
      "For maximum viral potential, the pacing needs to be so aggressive that each element feels like a distinct comic book panel. Think quick cuts: Netanyahu emerging, then instant smoke, then exploding panels, then a close-up of juggling trials and texting, all within a few seconds each, leading to the final WHAM! and flag reveal.",
