        "Allocate the first 3 seconds to a visually stunning, epic animated title card with a strong sound effect. Immediately follow with the baby dragon character introducing the \"dragon transformation machine\" for explaining transformation rules (approx. 5-7 seconds).",
        "Visually represent domain and range using 'territory maps' where the dragon navigates, clearly showing input (e.g., lands the dragon can fly over) and output (e.g., treasure it can reach). For one-to-one and onto, use distinct visual transformations where one input always yields a unique output, and all possible outputs are covered.",
        "For function composition, animate the dragon going through two sequential \"transformation machines.\" For even/odd functions, utilize the mirror and rotational symmetry metaphors directly on the dragon's form or its transformations.",
        "Ensure each explanation segment is 3-5 seconds maximum, with dialogue and visuals tightly synchronized. Incorporate recurring comedic character beats from the baby dragon, perhaps struggling with a concept or delivering a sarcastic punchline, to enhance the Family Guy style and virality.",
        "The technical approach should favor VEO-2's capability for dynamic transformations and character animation. Focus on sharp, clear visual metaphors that translate abstract concepts instantly. The 'dragon transformation machine' should be a recurring motif, adapting for different function types.",
        "Given the 40-second limit and the number of concepts (8 in total, plus title card), we need an average of ~4 seconds per function explanation. This necessitates extremely tight scripting, focusing on one core visual metaphor and a single sentence explanation per concept, with no room for fluff.",
        "The viral potential lies in the unexpected juxtaposition of complex math with a beloved comedic style and relatable visual metaphors. The 'dragon transformation machine' concept itself is inherently attention-grabbing for Instagram. Keep the 'Family Guy' humor subtle but present in the dragon's reactions and the absurdity of teaching math through dragon transformations."
