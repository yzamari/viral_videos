Visual metaphors like dragons fitting into shrinking blankets for epsilon-clustering and building 'bridge' cities for Dedekind cuts are crucial for rapid comprehension and shareability.",

Assigning distinct, over-the-top dragon personalities to explain parts of the theorem will enhance the Family Guy style and make the dense information digestible.  Focusing on the 'epsilon blanket' visual for clustering and 'Dedekind bridge' for completeness will be key.",

Prioritizing the 'epsilon blanket' for clustering and the 'Dedekind bridge' for completeness will visually anchor these abstract ideas. The key is to ensure each visual metaphor directly supports a distinct mathematical point, delivered by distinct dragon personalities within the tight 35-second timeframe.",
