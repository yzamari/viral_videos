The key is rapid, punchy visuals with equally impactful sound design, ensuring each gag lands within the tight 35-second timeframe. Visual emphasis should be on exaggerated movements and clear comic book effects, with the Hebrew dialogue perfectly synced to maintain the narrative flow and humor.",

Each key moment, from his desert emergence to the Declaration of Independence, must be treated as a distinct, dynamic comic panel, expertly synchronized with sound effects and dialogue for maximum comedic effect within the 35-second timeframe.",
