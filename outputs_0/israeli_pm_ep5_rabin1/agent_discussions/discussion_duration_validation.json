    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate approximately 5-7 seconds per key narrative beat (e.g., Rabin's introduction, transformation, Entebbe rescue, economic crisis, scandal, resignation, post-credit tease). Ensure sound design complements each visual, with distinct SFX for morphing, WHOOSH, SNAP, SHOCK, CLANG, and a rising ominous tone., Utilize dynamic camera movement or visual effects within each panel to maintain visual interest during shorter segments, paired with tightly timed voiceovers or impactful text overlays that are easily readable at a glance., Allocate approximately 8 seconds for the 'Young Rabin' and transformation sequence, utilizing fast morphing effects between soldier and PM panels to convey rapid change.",
