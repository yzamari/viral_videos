        "Prioritize the 'burts from desert sands' and 'British Mandate vanishes' moments for strong visual and audio impact early on, potentially dedicating 5-7 seconds each to maximize engagement.",

        "Allocate short, dynamic segments (2-3 seconds each) for the yoga headstands and kibbutz building to maintain visual interest without disrupting the overall flow or exceeding the duration limit.",

The key is to translate each specific narrative beat \u2013 from the desert emergence to the 'INEVITABLE' declaration, the vanishing mandate, exploding Declaration, yoga poses, kibbutz building, and the 'return' tease \u2013 into a concise, comic-book-style visual gag or action sequence.",

        "Allocate approximately 3-4 seconds for the iconic desert emergence and 'I am INEVITABLE!' line, ensuring a powerful opening.  The vanishing British Mandate should be a quick, visually striking comic smoke effect, no more than 2 seconds.",
        "Condense the Declaration of Independence with exploding panels and the 'KA-POW!' into a rapid 3-second sequence. The yoga headstands and kibbutz building should be shown in very brief, almost subliminal flashes (1-2 seconds each) to convey the activity without dwelling, perhaps using speed-ramping.",
        "The desert retirement and 'Ben-Gurion will return!' tease should be a final, impactful 3-second shot, leaving a lasting impression. Ensure the Israeli flag is consistently visible in the top-left corner throughout the edit, reinforcing the brand identity of the content.",

Each element needs to be a micro-moment of visual impact."
