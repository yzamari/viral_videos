The 3-second title card needs a massive sonic impact, immediately followed by quick, punchy soundbites for each concept, ensuring perfect sync with the rapid visual gags.",

The 3-second title card needs to be an auditory and visual explosion, immediately setting the tone. We should then structure the remaining ~37 seconds into 4-5 tightly scripted, visually distinct comedic bits (7-9 seconds each), each explaining one mathematical concept with a punchy joke and a clear, stylized animation.",
