1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,459
These little dragons make close
formations, just like Cauchy sequences

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,068
limit.

3
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:09,468
They always cluster within any tiny
epsilon box we give them.

4
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:14,079
For real numbers, being Cauchy means they
are guaranteed to converge to

5
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:14,866
something.

6
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:20,230
Compactness, like Heine-Borel, means we
can cover everything with finite blankets,

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,203
no holes!

8
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:25,911
Dedekind cuts define real numbers, showing
how Cauchy completion makes our number
