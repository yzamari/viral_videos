The 'Unknown Duration' needs to be precisely managed to hit the 63-second target \u00b15%, ensuring the content feels complete but doesn't overstay its welcome.",

      "suggestions": [
        "Utilize distinct, high-energy sound effects for the train, the dragon's voice, and each mathematical term/concept to enhance clarity and engagement. The 'CHOO CHOO!' should be iconic.",
        "Synchronize visual cues with the audio for each segment: a\u2081 a\u2082 a\u2083\u2026 appearing on cars, the station 'L' approaching, and the 'epsilon tunnel' visual representing closeness to L. This tight sync is critical for conveying the math visually and audibly."
