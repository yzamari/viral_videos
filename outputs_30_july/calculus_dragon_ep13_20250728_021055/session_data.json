  "mission": "Create a Family Guy style comedy where dragon detective investigates functions completely. Teach systematic function analysis: finding domain, critical points, using first and second derivative tests, finding inflection points, asymptotes, and sketching curves. Use visual metaphors: detective investigation, solving cases, mood swings for concavity. Make the complete function investigation process entertaining and memorable.",

    "original_script": "[VISUAL: A fire-breathing dragon detective in a trench coat examining a graph like a crime scene.] DIALOGUE: This case is a mess! My dragon senses detect a function in need of some serious analysis. [VISUAL: The dragon detective marking points on a graph, zooming in on specific areas.] DIALOGUE: First, we establish the domain: where can this suspect roam? Then, critical points \u2013 our prime suspects for ups and downs. [VISUAL: Animated graphs showing the function's slope and curvature changing, with the dragon observing.] DIALOGUE: The first derivative test reveals our suspect's mood swings, defining increases and decreases. The second derivative? That\u2019s concavity, the curve\u2019s emotional state. [VISUAL: The dragon detective drawing dotted lines for asymptotes and marking inflection points with an 'X'.] DIALOGUE: We hunt for asymptotes, the boundaries this function respects. Inflection points are where its attitude truly changes. [VISUAL: The dragon detective confidently sketching the complete function curve based on all the evidence.] DIALOGUE: With all the evidence gathered, we sketch the complete picture. Case closed: another function\u2019s mystery solved!",

The second derivative indicates concavity, the curve's emotional state. We seek asymptotes, the function's boundaries. Inflection points mark significant attitude shifts.
