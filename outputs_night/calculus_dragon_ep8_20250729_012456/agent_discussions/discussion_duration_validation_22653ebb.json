Then, ensure each subsequent math concept (epsilon-delta, one-sided limits, etc.) is explained within 1-2 short, visually distinct comedic flight scenes, ideally under 5-7 seconds each.",
        "Prioritize sound design for comedic effect: exaggerated dragon roars for 'teleporting' mishaps, 'whooshing' sounds for smooth flights, and comedic 'bonk' sounds for landing discontinuities. This will enhance the Family Guy-esque humor and make the technical explanations more memorable."

This requires extremely efficient scripting and animation."

For continuity, show the dragon's flight path as a single, unbroken line, contrasting with a 'teleporting' dragon for discontinuous movement."

This may necessitate simplifying the explanations to their absolute core, focusing on one key visual metaphor per concept."
