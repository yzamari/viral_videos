        "The Mean Value Theorems can be visualized through dragon marathon runners. Rolle's Theorem might involve two dragons finishing at the same altitude, implying a moment of same instantaneous speed (derivative) somewhere in between. Lagrange's MVT would be about average speed vs. instantaneous speed. Cauchy's MVT would involve comparing two dragons' speeds on different, but related, paths.",

Some theorems, like Cauchy's MVT, can be conceptually abstract, requiring careful visual and auditory translation to be digestible on Instagram."
