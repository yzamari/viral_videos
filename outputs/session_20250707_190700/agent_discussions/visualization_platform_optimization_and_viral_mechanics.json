          "message": "For this 30-second YouTube Short, the immediate focus must be on an incredibly strong visual and auditory hook within the first 1-3 seconds to leverage the Shorts algorithm's emphasis on watch time and retention. The comedic premise of 'unicorns in war' offers high potential for virality if the absurdity is delivered quickly and clearly. Optimizing for loopability or a satisfyingly abrupt ending will also maximize replays.",
