For the ratio/root tests, use a visual of a plant growing; if the growth rate is too fast (ratio > 1), the plant breaks free of its pot, representing divergence.",

For example, a 'ratio test' could involve the dragon trying to catch a sequence of rapidly appearing and disappearing objects, with a failed catch leading to comedic chaos.",
        "Ensure the visual metaphors for convergence/divergence are crystal clear.  For convergence, the dragon's rocket pack should land safely and predictably. For divergence, the rocket should spectacularly fail or fly off-screen, signifying uncontrolled growth.",
