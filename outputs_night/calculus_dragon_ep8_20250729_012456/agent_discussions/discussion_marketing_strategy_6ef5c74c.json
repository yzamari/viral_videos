By making the 'Smooth Dragon Flights' concept the core of the visual narrative, we can break down advanced mathematical ideas in a way that resonates with a general audience, driving both reach and engagement.",

        "Utilize split-screen or rapid cuts to contrast 'smooth' (continuous) flight with 'teleporting' (discontinuous) flight for clear visual metaphors of limits and continuity.",

'Epsilon' could be the acceptable landing zone deviation (a small shimmering circle), and 'delta' the dragon's approach speed variation required to stay within it. A 'teleporting' dragon would represent a discontinuity."
