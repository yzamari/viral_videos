    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate an average of 8 seconds per panel sequence, starting with Golda's imposing entrance and her 'MAN in the cabinet' line, followed by rapid visual gags of the kindergarten transformation. Transition swiftly through action-packed, yet brief, representations of the Yom Kippur War, intelligence failures, and rewind moments, utilizing sharp sound effects like 'KABOOM' and 'SNAP' to punctuate each panel's impact, and climax with the 'Internet Explodes' finale., To enhance virality, the 'Kitchen Diplomacy' segment will feature world leaders literally shrinking with a comedic 'shrinking' sound effect, immediately followed by the mushroom cloud resignation and the final, explosive statement 'There's no Palestine' paired with a visually overwhelming 'Internet EXPLODES' graphic and sound. This creates a powerful, albeit controversial, crescendo designed for maximum social media sharing and commentary., Script Segment 1 (0-8s): Golda emerges from smoke, cigarette glowing. Visual: Extreme close-up on her eyes, then wider shot with cigarette. Audio: Deep, resonant voice for 'I'm the only MAN in the cabinet!' + smoke sound effect. Subtitle: 'I'm the only MAN in the cabinet!'",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is maintaining clarity and impact across eight distinct narrative beats within the tight 65-second timeframe. Each panel must deliver its message instantly to avoid viewer fatigue or confusion, requiring extremely precise editing and asset synchronization.",
      "The primary concern is maintaining precise audio-visual synchronization across all eight distinct panels within the 65-second timeframe. Any drift could dilute the impact of the narrative and undermine the mission's objective.  Additionally, ensuring the final 'Internet EXPLODES' sound effect is both powerful and brief enough to avoid exceeding the time limit is crucial.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring that the rapid pacing and visual complexity of each 'panel' remain coherent and impactful within the 8-second allocation per segment. Overcrowding visuals or dialogue could dilute the message and impact of key moments, particularly the historical references and the final, provocative statement. Precise editing and sound design will be crucial to maintain clarity and narrative flow."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "For the 'Intelligence failure' panel, layer the sound of scattering files with a sharp 'SNAP' to underscore the rapid, impactful nature of the failure. The 'TIME REWIND' panels will utilize reversed audio sweeps, creating a disorienting but attention-grabbing effect that emphasizes the missed warnings.",
      "Allocate approximately 7-8 seconds per major panel, ensuring dynamic visual transitions and concise audio segments. For the 'YOM KIPPUR WAR' panel, blend the sound of a coffee slurp with the crackle of a tank radio, creating an immediate, multi-layered auditory cue. The final 'Internet EXPLODES' must be a sharp, digital 'POW' synchronized with explosive visuals.",
      "Use highly stylized comic book art with dynamic linework and bold coloring to enhance the 'Marvel Comics' aesthetic. Ensure fluid transitions between panels to maintain momentum and visual coherence.",

      "Incorporate a subtle, pulsing background score that builds in intensity, mirroring Golda's determination and the escalating historical events, peaking during the final, explosive panel.",
      "To enhance virality, the 'Kitchen Diplomacy' segment will feature world leaders literally shrinking with a comedic 'shrinking' sound effect, immediately followed by the mushroom cloud resignation and the final, explosive statement 'There's no Palestine' paired with a visually overwhelming 'Internet EXPLODES' graphic and sound. This creates a powerful, albeit controversial, crescendo designed for maximum social media sharing and commentary.",
