    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate no more than 3-4 seconds per concept, using quick cuts and strong visual gags for each mathematical idea (e.g., epsilon-delta is the dragon trying to land *exactly* on a tiny target, one-sided limits are approaches from distinct sides of a cliff)., Structure the script with a clear setup (dragon pilot struggling with a student, perhaps Stewie or Chris) and a recurring comedic beat where the pilot gets increasingly frustrated explaining the concepts, culminating in a classic Family Guy-esque abrupt ending or character interaction., Dedicate 3-4 seconds per concept, ensuring a quick visual gag for each: Epsilon-delta = precise, tiny landing adjustments; one-sided limits = approaching a landing strip from left vs. right; jump discontinuity = teleporting mid-flight; removable discontinuity = brief visual glitch; continuity = smooth, unbroken flight; IVT = guaranteed passage through an altitude range. Each gag should be punchy and end with a quick, sarcastic remark from the pilot.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting all the required mathematical topics (epsilon-delta, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity conditions, types of discontinuities, IVT) into 35 seconds without making it feel rushed or confusing. This will require significant simplification and clever visual storytelling to convey the essence of each topic accurately yet humorously.",
      "Ensuring the visual gags and dialogue for each concept are distinct and immediately understandable within the short format will be challenging, especially for concepts like the Cauchy criterion, which is more abstract than simple limits or continuity.",
      "The primary concern is cramming all these mathematical concepts, including Cauchy criterion and continuity conditions, into a mere 35 seconds without oversimplifying to the point of inaccuracy or losing the comedic flow. Visualizing abstract mathematical ideas through flight metaphors requires careful scripting and execution to be both funny and educational.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the required mathematical topics (epsilon-delta, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity conditions, discontinuities, IVT) into a coherent narrative within the strict 35-second limit without sacrificing clarity or comedic timing. The Cauchy criterion is particularly abstract for this format."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "For viral potential, focus on highly relatable 'fails' associated with the discontinuities, like a poorly executed landing (jump discontinuity) or a sudden, jarring teleport that frightens the pilot. The dragon pilot's escalating frustration as he tries to explain these concepts should be the comedic through-line, punctuated by exaggerated sound effects and visual cues reminiscent of Family Guy.",
      "The Cauchy criterion can be shown by the dragon having to consistently land closer and closer to a target with each pass, demonstrating convergence without actually hitting it yet. The pilot could be saying, 'We're getting *really* close, but not *there* yet!'",
      "For continuity, show the dragon performing a smooth, seamless barrel roll, with the pilot saying, 'See? No sudden altitude changes, just pure, unbroken flight.' This contrasts with teleporting.",
      "Use a 'jump discontinuity' by having the dragon teleport mid-flight, shouting 'Whoops! Forgot to pay my flight plan fee!' as it suddenly appears at a different altitude, leaving a puff of smoke.",
      "The Intermediate Value Theorem can be depicted by the dragon needing to fly *through* a specific altitude range to get to a destination. Show it consistently hitting all altitudes within that range during its smooth flight path, with the pilot smugly stating, 'Guaranteed to hit that altitude *somewhere*!'",
      "Dedicate 3-4 seconds per concept, ensuring a quick visual gag for each: Epsilon-delta = precise, tiny landing adjustments; one-sided limits = approaching a landing strip from left vs. right; jump discontinuity = teleporting mid-flight; removable discontinuity = brief visual glitch; continuity = smooth, unbroken flight; IVT = guaranteed passage through an altitude range. Each gag should be punchy and end with a quick, sarcastic remark from the pilot.",
      "For the epsilon-delta definition, show the dragon attempting a precise landing: The pilot shouts 'Stay within this tiny circle!' (epsilon) while adjusting controls with extreme precision (delta) as the dragon wobbles. A slight deviation means a crash into Peter Griffin's house.",
      "Allocate no more than 3-4 seconds per concept, using quick cuts and strong visual gags for each mathematical idea (e.g., epsilon-delta is the dragon trying to land *exactly* on a tiny target, one-sided limits are approaches from distinct sides of a cliff).",
      "To illustrate one-sided limits, have the dragon try to land on a platform, but a 'cliff' is on one side. Show it approaching from the left, then the right, with the pilot complaining about the different 'approach vectors' affecting the landing.",
      "Structure the script with a clear setup (dragon pilot struggling with a student, perhaps Stewie or Chris) and a recurring comedic beat where the pilot gets increasingly frustrated explaining the concepts, culminating in a classic Family Guy-esque abrupt ending or character interaction."

      "To make this Family Guy-style dragon pilot video engaging for Instagram within 35 seconds, we must prioritize rapid-fire, visually distinct flight analogies for each complex math concept. The humor will stem from the dragon pilot's exaggerated reactions and the absurdity of applying these concepts to flight, making abstract ideas tangible and shareable.",
      "To maximize engagement for this Family Guy-style dragon pilot video on Instagram within 35 seconds, we must pair each mathematical concept with a rapid, visually distinct flight analogy, leveraging the dragon pilot's exasperated persona for humor and making the abstract concepts intuitively understandable through cinematic flight scenarios.",
