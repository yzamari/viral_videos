        "The Intermediate Value Theorem can be illustrated by the dragon needing to pass through a specific altitude range to reach a destination; if it's always flying smoothly, it's guaranteed to hit all altitudes within that range.",
        "For one-sided limits, show the dragon approaching an obstacle from the left vs. the right \u2013 its trajectory might be different depending on the approach, but the goal is to predict its path *as* it gets close."

By prioritizing visual humor and concise analogies that map directly to flight actions, we create an intuitive learning experience for Instagram's audience, crucial for maximizing engagement and retention.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Allocate specific flight metaphors to each concept: Epsilon-delta can be fine-tuning landing gear for a precise landing point (delta) within an acceptable flight path deviation (epsilon). One-sided limits can be approaching a landing strip from either the left or right. Continuity is a smooth, uninterrupted flight path. Discontinuities are abrupt teleports or crashes. The IVT is guaranteeing a specific altitude can be reached somewhere between two points.",
