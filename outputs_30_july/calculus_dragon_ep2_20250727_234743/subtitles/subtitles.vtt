00:00.000 --> 00:01.720
Welcome aboard the Number Train.

00:01.720 --> 00:02.064
Our

00:02.364 --> 00:05.733
baby dragon conductor leads us to

00:06.033 --> 00:07.588
a special station.

00:07.588 --> 00:09.142
Each train car

00:09.442 --> 00:11.349
shows a sequence number, getting closer.

00:11.649 --> 00:12.772
This demonstrates convergence.

00:12.772 --> 00:13.896
See the tiny

00:14.196 --> 00:15.092
epsilon tunnels?

00:15.092 --> 00:16.886
They illustrate how numbers

00:17.186 --> 00:18.649
approach the limit.

00:18.649 --> 00:20.112
Bounds keep our

00:20.412 --> 00:21.936
train on track, within limits.

00:21.936 --> 00:22.240
No

00:22.540 --> 00:24.095
derailing is allowed.

00:24.095 --> 00:25.649
These math lessons

00:25.949 --> 00:26.883
make sequences and limits clear.

00:26.883 --> 00:28.378
We have learned about sequences and their
limits
