    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Design the title card with bold, impactful typography that evokes a sense of grandeur and humor, incorporating fiery dragon elements and Olympic rings. The animation should be explosive, perhaps with sparks and a roar, lasting precisely 3 seconds., Allocate roughly 3-4 seconds for each calculus concept, using distinct visual metaphors: chain rule as a dragon relay race passing a flaming baton, inverse function derivatives as dragons performing intricate gymnastics flips, higher derivatives as a dragon marathon with increasingly complex terrain, critical points as dragons strategically navigating treacherous treasure hunt maps, and the mean value theorems as dragons demonstrating perfect form in synchronized dives or high-jump events., **Title Card Typography:** Use a chunky, slightly distressed, sans-serif font like 'Impact' or a similar bold display font, perhaps with a metallic gradient (gold/bronze) and animated embers or shockwaves for 'epic effects'. Ensure it's highly readable at a glance.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The main concern is cramming all the specified calculus concepts into 40 seconds without feeling rushed or losing clarity. Each concept needs enough visual presence to be understood, even humorously, which requires extremely tight editing and extremely efficient visual storytelling.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the listed calculus concepts (chain rule, inverse function derivatives, higher derivatives, critical points, Fermat's theorem, Rolle's theorem, Lagrange mean value theorem, and Cauchy mean value theorem) into just 40 seconds without feeling rushed or confusing. Each concept needs a clear, concise visual representation and a brief, witty dialogue snippet.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the required calculus concepts and their visual metaphors into a mere 40 seconds without feeling rushed or sacrificing clarity. Each theorem needs to be discernible, even with the Family Guy comedic overlay.",
      "Condensing all the listed calculus theorems into 40 seconds with sufficient visual explanation and humor without feeling rushed or confusing is the primary challenge.",
      "Ensuring the 'Family Guy' humor lands while also accurately (albeit metaphorically) representing the calculus theorems will be a delicate balance. The humor must not overshadow the educational or thematic intent."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "**Theorem Representation:** Rolle's Theorem could be a dragon gracefully jumping between two points on a hyperbolic curve, landing perfectly.  Lagrange's MVT could be a dragon mid-marathon, with a commentator pointing to a tangent line parallel to the secant line drawn on the course.",
      "Assign distinct visual metaphors for each event: Chain Rule as a multi-dragon relay, Inverse Functions as a dragon navigating a complex maze, Higher Derivatives as a dragon performing intricate aerial acrobatics, and the theorems as synchronized diving routines or precision treasure hunts, all imbued with exaggerated 'Family Guy' comedic timing.",
      "Allocate roughly 3-4 seconds for each calculus concept, using distinct visual metaphors: chain rule as a dragon relay race passing a flaming baton, inverse function derivatives as dragons performing intricate gymnastics flips, higher derivatives as a dragon marathon with increasingly complex terrain, critical points as dragons strategically navigating treacherous treasure hunt maps, and the mean value theorems as dragons demonstrating perfect form in synchronized dives or high-jump events.",

      "**Pacing and Transitions:** Rapid cuts between events are crucial. Use quick wipes or slide transitions that mimic Olympic broadcast graphics, keeping the energy high and preventing any single concept from overstaying its welcome.",
      "For each calculus event, use quick, punchy animations mirroring Family Guy's style: a dragon in a high-stakes marathon for the mean value theorem, or a dragon meticulously searching for treasure for critical points (Fermat's Theorem).",
      "For the title card, animate 'Dragon Calculus Olympics' with letters erupting in flames, then transitioning to a gold medal sheen, with a triumphant orchestral swell. Use a bright, energetic color palette dominated by fiery oranges, deep reds, and shimmering golds.",
      "Design the title card with bold, metallic gold typography that blasts onto the screen with fiery trails and a roaring dragon sound effect, immediately capturing attention.",
      "**Event Metaphor Visualization:** For the chain rule relay, imagine dragons passing glowing batons representing function compositions.  For critical points, a dragon gymnist might perform a flawless routine landing precisely on a mathematical peak or valley."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To make the 'Dragon Calculus Olympics' engaging on Instagram within 40 seconds, we need a dynamic title card that instantly conveys the theme, followed by rapid-fire visual metaphors for each calculus concept. Each event should be visually distinct, using Family Guy's signature humor and animation style to represent complex theorems as exciting, competitive moments.",
      "For 'Dragon Calculus Olympics' on Instagram, the massive animated title card needs bold, impactful typography set against a dynamic, gold-medal-themed background, immediately establishing the 'Family Guy' comedic tone. Each calculus event, from the chain rule relay to Rolle's theorem gymnastics, should be visually distinct, using rapid cuts and humorous animations to make abstract concepts digestible and entertaining for the 40-second runtime.",
      "To maximize impact for 'Dragon Calculus Olympics' on Instagram within 40 seconds, the title card must be a vibrant spectacle of gold and fire, embodying the 'Family Guy' aesthetic with dynamic, bold typography that screams 'EPISODE 10'. Each calculus concept needs a swift, humorous visual metaphor, like dragons in a relay race for the chain rule or a dragon attempting impossible gymnastics for Rolle's theorem, ensuring rapid engagement and emotional resonance for a broad audience."

  "key_insights": [
    "Instagram thrives on fast-paced, visually arresting content. For this specific topic, blending the absurdity of Family Guy with the rigor of calculus, rapid visual storytelling is key. The title card needs to be an immediate hook, setting the tone for the entire 40-second runtime.",
    "Maximizing engagement on Instagram within a tight 40-second window requires a high-impact visual hook.  The 'Family Guy' style lends itself perfectly to absurdly funny interpretations of complex mathematical theorems as competitive events, driving shareability.",
    "The key is to translate abstract calculus concepts into universally understood, emotionally charged competitive scenarios within the 'Family Guy' humor framework. This blend of educational content with comedic, visually stimulating Olympic events creates an inherently shareable and memorable experience, perfect for Instagram's fast-paced consumption.",
    "This approach leverages the platform's short attention span by front-loading excitement and making abstract calculus concepts relatable and humorous through iconic visual metaphors."
