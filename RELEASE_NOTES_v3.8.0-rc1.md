# Release v3.8.0-rc1 - Enhanced News Aggregator with Optimized Display

## 🎯 Major Improvements

### 1. Fixed Duration Calculation
- **Issue**: Videos were generating at incorrect durations (75s or 102s instead of requested 30s)
- **Root Cause**: Minimum time per clip logic was overriding user's duration parameter
- **Fix**: Removed minimum time enforcement, now respects exact user-specified duration
- **Result**: Videos generate at exactly the requested duration

### 2. Text Display Optimization
- **Issue**: Text was cluttered and unreadable with overlapping content
- **Improvements**:
  - Reduced AI-generated content from 200-300 chars to max 60 chars
  - Removed verbose content descriptions
  - Shows only satirical title and original title
  - Increased font sizes to 100px for titles, 60px for supporting text
  - Uses 95-98% of screen width for better visibility

### 3. Improved Text Positioning
- **Title Position**: Moved from 15% to 22% of screen height for better framing
- **Footer Text**: Moved from 80% to 70% of screen height
- **Removed**: "Original:" prefix from footer text for cleaner display

### 4. AI Performance Optimization
- **Issue**: Timeout when processing 50+ stories
- **Fix**: Smart selection cap at 15 stories when max_stories > 10
- **Result**: Fast processing without timeouts while maintaining quality selection

### 5. Enhanced Satirical Content Generation
- **Improved AI prompts for genuine satirical content
- **Shorter, punchier headlines that are actually funny
- **Better tone/style adaptation without hardcoded assumptions
