  "script_content": "Alright, Stewie, we are finding treasure on this map section! The Extreme Value Theorem indicates the best and worst loot is at the edges or peaks. This dragon's velocity is uniformly continuous; it will not teleport. Derivatives represent dragon velocity; they show our speed at any point. If a function is differentiable, it is continuous, unlike this bumpy dragon ride. We must use this to our advantage during this treasure hunt. The map shows a clear path, let us follow it carefully. Remember, Stewie, patience is key to success. We do not want to anger the dragon. This treasure is worth the effort. Our success depends on precision and timing. Are you ready, Stewie? Let us proceed with caution",
