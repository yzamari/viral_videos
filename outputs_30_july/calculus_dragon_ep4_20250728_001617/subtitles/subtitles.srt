Stewie's stuck on infinite stairs,
realizing he is climbing a

00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:06,349
monotonic sequence.

00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:10,069
He gets stuck in time loops, his recursive

00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:11,960
sequences repeating endlessly.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,672
He learns about number 'e' and nested

6
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:18,833
intervals, like shrinking Russian dolls.

7
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,693
Subsequences appear, tiny versions of

00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:24,422
the journey, hinting at
Bolzano-Weierstrass.

9
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:26,852
A bounded monotonic sequence must

00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,741
converge, even if the stairs never end!
