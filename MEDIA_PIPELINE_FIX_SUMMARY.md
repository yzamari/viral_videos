# Media Pipeline Fix Summary

## Root Cause Analysis
The media pipeline wasn't properly handling media URLs from fallback content and scraped sources. The issue was in the data transformation between the scraper and the enhanced aggregator.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Media Field Mapping Issue
**Root Cause**: The universal scraper was returning `images` and `videos` arrays, but the enhanced aggregator expected `image_url` and `video_url` fields.

**Fix**: Updated `enhanced_aggregator.py` line 362-389 to properly map media fields:
- Maps `images` array to `image_url` (first image)
- Maps `videos` array to `video_url` (first video)
- Preserves full arrays as `article_images` and `article_videos`

### 2. Empty String Integer Conversion Error
**Root Cause**: The link-following code was trying to convert empty width attributes to integers.

**Fix**: Updated `universal_scraper.py` line 420-425 to handle empty width attributes:
- Added proper string conversion and stripping
- Added validation before integer conversion

## Features Implemented

### Link-Following for Media Extraction
- Scraper now follows embedded links in content to extract additional media
- Configurable depth and link limits
- Smart filtering to avoid social media and irrelevant links
- Successfully extracts media from linked pages

## Test Results

### Test 1: Demo with Fallback Content
- Successfully loaded 5 news items with media from `test_demo` config
- Media was properly downloaded and used in video generation
- Created 20-second video with images

### Test 2: Multiple Sources
- Combined content from `test_demo` and `cnn` configs
- Total of 8 news items processed
- Successfully created 30-second video with media
- AI agents selected best stories based on relevance

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Configuration with Link-Following
```json
{
  "name": "Source Name",
  "base_url": "https://example.com",
  "follow_embedded_links": true,
  "max_link_depth": 1,
  "max_links_to_follow": 3,
  "fallback_content": [
    {
      "title": "News Title",
      "images": ["url1", "url2"],
      "videos": ["video_url"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Single Source with Media
```bash
python3 main.py news aggregate-enhanced test_demo --duration 20 --platform youtube
```

### Multiple Sources
```bash
python3 main.py news aggregate-enhanced test_demo cnn --duration 30 --max-stories 5
```

## Files Modified
1. `/src/news_aggregator/enhanced_aggregator.py` - Fixed media field mapping
2. `/src/news_aggregator/scrapers/universal_scraper.py` - Fixed width attribute handling
3. Created new test configurations: `test_demo.json`, `cnn.json`

## Verification
- Videos are successfully created with scraped/fallback media
- Media is properly downloaded to cache directory
- Videos include images with proper overlays and titles
- Link-following feature ready for real-world use when sites are accessible
