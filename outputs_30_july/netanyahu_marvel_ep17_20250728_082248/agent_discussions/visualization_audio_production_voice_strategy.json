Each action, from the Knesset crash to the final flag lightning, needs a distinct, exaggerated audio cue, like classic comic book onomatopoeia, to drive the pacing and maintain audience attention within the tight 35-second timeframe. The voiceover should be punchy and delivered with a dramatic flair to match the over-the-top visuals and sound design.",
