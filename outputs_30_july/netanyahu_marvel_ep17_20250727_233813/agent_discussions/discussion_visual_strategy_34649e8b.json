The 35-second Instagram constraint necessitates aggressive pacing, where each element, from dialogue to sound effects, must land with maximum impact in minimal time to avoid overwhelming the audience or losing clarity.",

        "Segment the script into 4-5 distinct visual sequences, each approximately 7-9 seconds, to accommodate all described actions (Knesset crash, vanishing opposition, exploding panels, juggling/texting, energy beams, judicial reform visual, flag). Each sequence should feature a primary action with its associated sound effect and dialogue.",
        "Employ VEO-2's capability for dynamic visual transitions that mimic comic book panels, such as 'pop-out' effects for explosions and 'smash' transitions for the Knesset wall breach. Integrate bold, stylized on-screen text for key phrases like 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' to reinforce the comic book theme and aid comprehension.",
        "Ensure the 'juggling corruption trials while texting' and 'building settlements with energy beams' segments are visually distinct and brief, possibly using split-screen or rapid cuts to show multiple elements simultaneously. The judicial reform controversy can be visualized as a crack appearing across a stylized national symbol.",
        "Prioritize high-contrast, vibrant colors and sharp, comic-book-style rendering for all visual elements, including characters, environments, and special effects like lightning and comic smoke, to align with the 'Marvel Comics explosion!' theme and enhance visual appeal on Instagram."

Each action needs to be immediately recognizable and impactful.",
        "Maintaining visual clarity and avoiding motion blur or over-rendering in rapid transitions is crucial. The VEO-2 engine must be capable of generating these distinct effects seamlessly and efficiently within the very short allocated times for each action.",
        "The potential for visual noise or audio clutter is high given the number of sound effects and distinct visual events. Careful mixing and prioritizing of audio elements will be essential to ensure key dialogue and sound cues are discernible."

      "suggestions": [
        "Visually, we should animate key elements like lightning bolts emanating from Netanyahu and the comic smoke dissipating opposition parties, ensuring these are distinct and attention-grabbing within 1-2 second segments.

        "For the 'juggling multiple corruption trials while texting' and 'building settlements with energy beams' segments, consider split-screen or fast-paced montages of quick shots to convey the multitude of actions efficiently. The 'judicial reform controversy splits the nation' could be visualized with a dramatic, crackling energy effect across the screen, and the final flag shot needs to be a powerful, stylized graphic with prominent lightning effects."
