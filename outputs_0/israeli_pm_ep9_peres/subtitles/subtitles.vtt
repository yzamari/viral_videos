00:00.000 --> 00:00.684
The throne awaits;

00:00.684 --> 00:01.368
Peres finally sits.

00:01.368 --> 00:02.616
But the 'Acting PM' title mocks

00:02.616 --> 00:04.296
his every move.

00:04.296 --> 00:05.976
He reaches for

00:05.976 --> 00:10.224
the gavel, a weighty symbol of

00:10.224 --> 00:14.088
power, strain etched deep on his

00:14.088 --> 00:14.248
face.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.048
Operation Grapes erupts, a nightmare

00:15.048 --> 00:17.788
of missiles raining down uncontrollably.

00:17.788 --> 00:18.336
What

00:18.336 --> 00:19.044
have I done?

00:19.044 --> 00:19.752
The Qana disaster

00:19.752 --> 00:20.664
unfolds, a catastrophic accident.

00:20.664 --> 00:21.120
Horror grips

00:21.120 --> 00:21.712
the nation.

00:21.712 --> 00:22.896
The election battle rages;

00:22.896 --> 00:24.064
Bibi and Peres clash.

00:24.064 --> 00:24.648
A razor-thin

00:24.648 --> 00:25.864
margin of one percent!

00:25.864 --> 00:26.472
An agonizingly

00:26.472 --> 00:27.208
close defeat.

00:27.208 --> 00:28.680
Always the bridesmaid, never

00:28.680 --> 00:29.000
the bride.

00:29.000 --> 00:29.160
Mr.

00:29.160 --> 00:29.640
Peace becomes President

00:29.640 --> 00:31.320
ofâ€¦ nothing at all.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.160
At ninety-three,

00:32.160 --> 00:35.856
his dreams dim, a legacy unfulfilled.
