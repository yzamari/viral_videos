    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: **Voice Strategy:** Employ a versatile narrator with dynamic range \u2013 starting with a heroic, confident tone for Rabin, shifting to urgent and action-packed for Entebbe, then a somber, dramatic tone for the betrayal and resignation, culminating in a low, menacing whisper for the post-credit scene. The 'What If...?' line should be delivered with a chilling, existential dread., **Sound Design Synergy:** Design distinct, punchy sound effects for each key moment: a subtle shimmering for the 'morph' transition, a powerful WHOOSH for the sky-drop, a sharp SNAP for the economic collapse, a discordant SHOCK effect for the scandal reveal, a heavy CLANG for the dropped shield, and a subtle, rising ominous drone for the post-credit sequence to build suspense and foreshadow future events., Implement a 'quick cut' editing style for each panel, with exaggerated comic book sound effects (e.g., SNAP, WHOOSH, CLANG) synchronized to visual actions to create a dynamic and engaging rhythm that fits within the tight 65-second window.",
