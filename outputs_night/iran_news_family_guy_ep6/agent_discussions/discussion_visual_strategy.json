    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Execute the 'identical candidates' gag with extremely subtle visual cues to make the voter's line immediately understandable, perhaps using the same character model with minor, almost imperceptible differences. The cutaway to the 'Suggestions' ballot box needs a quick, attention-grabbing animation style distinct from the news segment., The final reveal of the second Maryam should be a rapid visual cut, with both characters immediately starting to drink, emphasizing the absurd and dark humor for a memorable, shareable punchline. Ensure the news ticker and lower third graphics are visually clear and don't detract from the main action., Ensure the 'identical candidates' are visually near-identical but perhaps have one subtle, absurd difference to amplify the 'policies' joke, like a slightly different tie color or a misplaced button. The quick cutaway to the 'Suggestions' ballot box should be a jarring, comedic visual shift, perhaps with a slight zoom or dramatic angle.",

      "The primary technical concern is fitting all narrative beats and visual gags\u2014Maryam's slurred announcement, identical candidates, voter reaction, ballot box cutaway, Chris's count, news ticker, lower third, and the double Maryam reveal\u2014into the strict 40-second window without sacrificing clarity or comedic timing.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all narrative beats and visual gags into the tight 40-second window without sacrificing clarity or comedic timing, especially ensuring the dialogue is easily understood with Maryam's slurring.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the distinct gags \u2013 Maryam's opening, identical candidates, voter reaction, ballot box cutaway, Chris's count, news ticker, lower third, and the double Maryam reveal \u2013 into the strict 40-second window without any feel rushed, which could dilute the comedic impact."

      "The news ticker and lower third should be presented clearly but with that 'Family Guy' visual flair \u2013 perhaps slightly off-kilter or with rapid animation.

      "Execute the 'identical candidates' gag with subtle visual differences, possibly a slight shift in facial expression or prop, for immediate comedic recognition, allowing approximately 5-7 seconds for this segment including the voter's line. The cutaway to the 'Suggestions' ballot box should be a swift, sharp visual shift, occupying only 3-4 seconds to maintain momentum.",
