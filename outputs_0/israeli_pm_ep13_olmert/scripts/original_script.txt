Surprise PM panel! Olmert declared, 'I did not ask for this!' It was like a spider bite accident. Lebanon War two panels launched an attack. Everything went completely wrong with a boom and a crash. The Winograd investigation felt like SHIELD-style interrogation panels. Secret talks offered Jerusalem. They even said, 'Take the Infinity Gauntlet!' Imagine that power. Corruption panels showed Hydra heads multiplying. Cash envelopes rained down like a storm. Then came the prison fitting. The Iron Man armor removal sequence started. Clank! Prison stripes. The first Prime Minister behind bars. A cell echo. He thought, 'I almost made peace.' Memoir writing panel: 'If only they knew...' a thought bubble filled with despair.
