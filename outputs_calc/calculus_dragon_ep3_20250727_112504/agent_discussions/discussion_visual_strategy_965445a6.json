        "For 'nth root of constant: Dragon shrinking spell!', visually represent the dragon shrinking rapidly with a distinct sound effect and clear voiceover. This creates an immediate, memorable link between the abstract concept and a tangible visual. Follow this with 'nth root of n approaches 1: 'Magic stabilization!'', showing the dragon's rocket pack stabilizing during flight with a smooth, controlled animation.",
        "To illustrate 'ZOOM to infinity!' and 'Some sequences go FOREVER!', employ rapid, escalating camera zooms with the dragon soaring through increasingly vast, stylized environments, accompanied by an energetic soundtrack. Then, for 'Divergence in extended sense,' we'll show the dragon's flight path becoming increasingly erratic and unpredictable, perhaps weaving through a chaotic, expanding nebula.",
        "When demonstrating 'Ratio test: 'Compare neighbors!', visually present two dragon plants side-by-side, one growing visibly faster than the other. The narration 'If ratio < 1, we converge!' should coincide with the slower-growing plant reaching a stable, albeit smaller, size, while the faster one continues, subtly illustrating the convergence idea. For 'Root test with dragon plants growing', animate the growth of the plants to show a pattern of predictable expansion.",
        "Depict 'Epsilon chicks multiply rapidly showing divergence' with a flurry of tiny, energetic dragon chicks hatching and scattering chaotically around the main dragon, visually representing uncontrolled growth and divergence.
