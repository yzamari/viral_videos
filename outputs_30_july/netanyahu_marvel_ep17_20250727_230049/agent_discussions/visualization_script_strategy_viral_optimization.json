The key is to create a hyper-stylized, comic-book-esque sequence that is both humorous and memorable.",

Each action, from the Knesset crash to the judicial reform split, needs an immediate, punchy visual and sonic counterpart, mirroring classic comic book panels to maximize impact within the 35-second runtime.  The key is relentless pace and exaggerated, satirical visual gags that tell the story quickly and hilariously.",

The key is relentless pace and exaggerated, satirical visual elements that tell the story with immediate audio-visual impact.",
