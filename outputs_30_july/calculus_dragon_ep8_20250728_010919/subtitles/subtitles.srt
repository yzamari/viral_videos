1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,821
Alright Lois, see this smooth flight

2
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:03,360
path?

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,318
That is a limit.

4
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:04,557
We

5
00:00:04,857 --> 00:00:08,097
approach the destination without actually
reaching

6
00:00:08,397 --> 00:00:09,037
it.

7
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:12,237
If the dragon vanished and

8
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:14,940
reappeared, that is not a limit;

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,765
it is rude teleporting, Brian.

10
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:18,270
We

11
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,515
land from the left, we land

12
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:23,677
from the right.

13
00:00:23,677 --> 00:00:24,539
Both directions must

14
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,589
match, or the operation is chaotic.

15
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:27,951
See that perfect landing?

16
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:28,482
No sudden

17
00:00:28,782 --> 00:00:29,009
jolts.

18
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:29,688
That is continuity.

19
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:30,141
The flight

20
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:31,712
is smooth.

21
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:34,255
Even with altitude changes,

22
00:00:34,555 --> 00:00:35,600
the flight remains unbroken.

23
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,734
It is all connected, like Stewie's evil
plans, but with more precision
