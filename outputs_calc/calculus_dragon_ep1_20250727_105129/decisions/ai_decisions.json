    "reasoning": "The 'Family Guy' reference immediately suggests a bold, humorous, and animated visual style. A cartoon approach perfectly captures the whimsical and exaggerated nature of the descriptions (e.g., 'infinite dragons', 'dragon hugs'). Vibrant colors will enhance the playful and engaging nature of the content for a general audience on Instagram, making the abstract mathematical concepts more approachable and memorable. This style aligns with typical popular content on platforms like Instagram.",
