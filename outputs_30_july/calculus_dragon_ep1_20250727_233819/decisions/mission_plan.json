  "mission_statement": "Create a Family Guy style educational comedy where baby dragon professor Epsilon teaches number sets. Cover natural numbers, integers, rational and irrational numbers, the real number line, absolute value, intervals, bounded sets, and supremum. Use visual metaphors: counting cookies for natural numbers, ice cubes for negative numbers, pizza slices for fractions, infinite spiral for irrational numbers. Make it funny and engaging for calculus students while teaching key concepts. The dragon should have a comedic personality and use humor to explain mathematical concepts.",
  "mission_type": "teach",
  "is_strategic_mission": true,
  "target_outcome": "Achieve a 5% engagement rate (likes, comments, shares) and a 10% average watch time on the Instagram video, demonstrating understanding of at least two number set concepts (e.g., natural numbers and integers) by viewers in comments or shares.",
  "strategic_approach": "Employ a fast-paced, visually driven comedic approach leveraging the Family Guy style and Professor Epsilon's personality to introduce number sets in a memorable and engaging way. Focus on strong visual metaphors and punchlines to maximize information retention within the time constraint.",
