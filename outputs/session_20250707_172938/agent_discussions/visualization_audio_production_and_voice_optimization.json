We need to create distinct, often absurd, vocal personas for all characters, including the unicorns, and ensure sound effects are as ridiculous as the premise. Clarity and comedic timing in the vocal delivery are paramount.",

We need to cast voice actors capable of extreme vocal versatility, delivering highly exaggerated emotional responses and distinct, often absurd, character voices for both humans and, critically, the unicorns. Precision in comedic timing and pacing will be essential to land every laugh.",

We need to craft bespoke, emotionally resonant (in a comedic sense) sound effects that amplify character reactions and narrative beats, making the audio a key driver of the humor.",
