          "message": "To make this Family Guy-style comedy about Taylor series engaging for Instagram, we must prioritize rapid-fire visual gags tied to mathematical concepts. Condensing the dense curriculum into 35 seconds requires a focus on visual metaphors like the crystal ball for increasing precision and shrinking errors, with quick, punchy dialogue for each segment. The key is to ensure the humor enhances, rather than obscures, the core mathematical ideas.",

The dragon's crystal ball will be the central visual metaphor, showing increasingly accurate predictions as terms are added, with shrinking errors personified as comedic 'blips' that get vanquished. This approach ensures the humor enhances understanding by providing constant visual feedback on convergence and precision.",
