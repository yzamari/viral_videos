The audio should transition from a bombastic Marvel score to whimsical Ghibli chimes, a warm grandma's voice, and then an energetic party track, ensuring each segment lands its comedic beat.  The drunk guy's line needs perfect comedic timing and vocal inflection for maximum hilarity.",

The audio should transition from epic Marvel scores to whimsical Ghibli chimes, a warm grandma's voice, and an energetic party track. The drunk guy's line requires perfect comedic timing and vocal inflection to land the punchline. Ensuring seamless transitions between these distinct audio styles is paramount for maintaining comedic flow and audience attention within the 32-second timeframe.",
