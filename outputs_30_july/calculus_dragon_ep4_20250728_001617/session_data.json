  "mission": "Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon explores monotonic sequences on infinite stairs and recursive sequences in time loops. Teach monotonic convergence theorem, recursive sequences, the number e, nested intervals, subsequences, and Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Use visual metaphors: climbing/descending stairs, time loops for recursion, shrinking boxes for nested intervals. Make it funny while explaining how bounded monotonic sequences must converge.",

[VISUAL: Stewie enters a time loop, repeatedly saying 'What the hell?'] DIALOGUE: He gets stuck in time loops, his recursive sequences repeating endlessly. [VISUAL: Stewie tries to hold the number E, it keeps shrinking.] DIALOGUE: He learns about number 'e' and nested intervals, like shrinking Russian dolls. [VISUAL: Stewie sees a tiny dragon in a vast stairwell.] DIALOGUE: Subsequences appear, tiny versions of the journey, hinting at Bolzano-Weierstrass. [VISUAL: Stewie sits on a bounded, ever-decreasing stair.] DIALOGUE: A bounded monotonic sequence must converge, even if the stairs never end!",
