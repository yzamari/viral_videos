    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate the first 3 seconds for the HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD with epic, attention-grabbing sound design, immediately setting a comedic tone. Then, ensure each subsequent math concept (epsilon-delta, one-sided limits, etc.) is explained within 1-2 short, visually distinct comedic flight scenes, ideally under 5-7 seconds each., Prioritize sound design for comedic effect: exaggerated dragon roars for 'teleporting' mishaps, 'whooshing' sounds for smooth flights, and comedic 'bonk' sounds for landing discontinuities. This will enhance the Family Guy-esque humor and make the technical explanations more memorable., Allocate precisely 3 seconds for the 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' animated title card, leaving approximately 35-39 seconds for all mathematical concepts. This requires a swift, almost blink-and-you'll-miss-it approach to each visual gag explaining continuity or limits.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is cramming all the outlined mathematical concepts into the very limited runtime, even with rapid-fire analogies. We must be ruthless in trimming dialogue and visuals to the absolute essentials for each concept.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the specified mathematical concepts (epsilon-delta, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity conditions, discontinuities, intermediate value theorem) into a sub-40-second video while maintaining clarity and the comedic tone, especially with the initial 3-second title card. This requires extremely efficient scripting and animation.",
      "The primary concern is cramming all the specified mathematical concepts (epsilon-delta, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity conditions, types of discontinuities, intermediate value theorem) into the remaining 35-39 seconds after the title card, given the complexity and the need for comedic buildup and payoff for each. This may necessitate simplifying the explanations to their absolute core, focusing on one key visual metaphor per concept."

      "Prioritize the visual metaphors: 'Smooth flying' for continuity, 'teleporting' for discontinuities, and 'landing from different directions' for one-sided limits, to create immediate comprehension and humor within Instagram's fast-paced consumption.",
      "Allocate approximately 5-7 seconds per mathematical concept (epsilon-delta, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity, discontinuities, IVT) after the title card, ensuring each segment has a distinct flight visual and a concise, punchy dialogue.",

      "Visually, represent the epsilon-delta definition as a dragon precisely navigating a narrow canyon, where even the slightest deviation (epsilon) is unacceptable for reaching the landing zone (delta). For continuity, show the dragon's flight path as a single, unbroken line, contrasting with a 'teleporting' dragon for discontinuous movement.",

      "To make 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' engaging for Instagram, we need to deliver the complex math concepts through rapid, visually driven comedic analogies, ensuring the Family Guy style humor is front-loaded. The key is to create incredibly tight, punchy segments that explain each concept with a clear flight visual, maintaining a high energy pace suitable for the platform's short-form nature.",
      "To make 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' a hit on Instagram, we must ensure each mathematical concept, from epsilon-delta to the Intermediate Value Theorem, is visually represented through rapid-fire, comedic flight analogies that are both entertaining and instantly understandable. The key will be meticulously timing each segment to fit within the 40-second target, allowing the 3-second title card and ensuring the Family Guy-style humor lands effectively without rushing the educational content.",
      "To maximize engagement for 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' on Instagram, we need to ensure each math concept is instantly visual and hilariously tied to dragon flight analogies, maintaining a rapid pace after the initial 3-second title card. The key to fitting all dense mathematical content within the tight duration is to pre-visualize every concept with clear, comedic flight metaphors for maximum impact and memorability."

    "Instagram thrives on quick, digestible content. By focusing on the visual metaphors and comedic delivery, we can make abstract math principles accessible and entertaining, crucial for capturing and retaining attention within the platform's typical viewing habits.",
    "Focusing on the core of the request \u2013 making complex math funny and accessible through flight on Instagram \u2013 requires a precise balance of visual comedy and educational clarity within a very strict time constraint. Adhering to the 40-second target (\u00b15%) is paramount for Instagram engagement and watchability.",
    "The success hinges on delivering complex calculus concepts via exceptionally short, visually driven, comedic segments that leverage the dragon flight theme. Efficient synchronization across all agents will be crucial to ensure the rapid-fire delivery of these analogies maintains the Family Guy style humor while accurately conveying the math."
