        "For monotonic sequences, start with the dragon joyfully climbing infinite stairs, then cut to it utterly exhausted and confused as the stairs never end. This visually demonstrates an increasing sequence that is unbounded. Then, for boundedness, show it hesitantly descending, but only managing to go down slightly each time, creating a sense of limited movement and increasing frustration, illustrating a decreasing sequence that is bounded below. The narration can tie this to the monotonic convergence theorem: 'See, a bounded monotonic sequence HAS to stop somewhere, or else this little guy would be working out forever!'",
        "For recursion, use the time loop visual with the dragon repeatedly trying to get a single cookie from a dispenser that resets. Each loop should have a slight, humorous variation, like the dispenser making a different noise or the dragon trying a new, absurd tactic. The 'solution' can be the dragon realizing it can use a previous loop's action to its advantage, showcasing the recursive nature of finding a pattern within repetition. The 'e' could be a perpetually growing pile of cookies that the dragon tries to count, always failing to reach the end of the current pile, symbolizing exponential growth.
