1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
All aboard the Sequence Express!

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:01,919
Each

3
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,703
car represents a , a₂, a₃…

4
00:00:04,703 --> 00:00:05,231
CHOO CHOO!

5
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:06,288
We are headed to

6
00:00:06,288 --> 00:00:06,976
the limit.

7
00:00:06,976 --> 00:00:08,352
This train journey approaches

8
00:00:08,352 --> 00:00:09,312
station L.

9
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:11,231
Convergence means approaching closer

10
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:12,192
and closer.

11
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:14,111
The Epsilon tunnel brings

12
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:14,811
us within epsilon of L.

13
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:14,951
What

14
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:16,063
a feat!

15
00:00:16,063 --> 00:00:18,287
The unique limit theorem

16
00:00:18,287 --> 00:00:19,231
guarantees only one destination.

17
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:19,703
No detours

18
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:20,911
are permitted.

19
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:23,327
Bounded sequences remain on

20
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:24,787
track, never straying too far.

21
00:00:24,787 --> 00:00:25,079
They

22
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,383
are dependable travelers.

23
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:29,687
The arithmetic of

24
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:31,319
limits functions , multiplication, all
work

25
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:32,135
perfectly.

26
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:35,399
It is mathematical magic!

27
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,215
The

28
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:37,722
Sandwich theorem is a delightful delicious
sequence sandwich!

29
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:38,663
Even epsilon chicks converge beautifully
