Each segment's audio will be meticulously mixed to match the visual pacing, with sound effects and music enhancing the narrative., Prioritize audio-visual sync for maximum impact. The 'Ant-Man' materialization should be accompanied by a distinct shrinking/growing sound effect. The 'overshadowed' montage requires a fast, percussive beat and the rustling of papers.

The visual and narrative elements must clearly transition from lighthearted comparison to highlighting genuine historical impact.",

        "**Voice Style & Delivery:** The inner monologue should be delivered with a subtly world-weary but determined tone, akin to a grounded superhero, while the Stan Lee cameo voice should be distinctly recognizable and slightly befuddled. For Sharett's initial spoken line, a slightly more formal but impactful delivery is needed.",
        "**Sound Design Integration:** Implement distinct audio cues for each Marvel parallel: a 'shrink/grow' effect for the Ant-Man materialization, a percussive, layered soundscape with paper rustling for the montage, ethereal, complex tones for Doctor Strange's diplomatic skills, a deep, unsettling rumble for the Ben-Gurion shadow, and a comedic sting for the post-credit scene.",
        "**Audio-Visual Synchronization:** Meticulously sync every sound effect and dialogue cue to the visual beats. For instance, the 'papers flying' montage needs the audio to match the visual speed and intensity. The diplomatic skills segment requires music to swell precisely with the visual representations of peace treaties, and the shadow reveal needs a powerful audio crescendo to accompany the visual takeover, ensuring the entire 65-second runtime is tightly controlled \u00b15%.",
        "**Music Strategy:** Utilize a score that evolves from a subtle, slightly melancholic theme that builds to an empowering, heroic crescendo during the diplomatic skills segment, and then shifts to a dramatic, ominous tone for the villain reveal.

The voiceover should be clear, well-paced, and capable of conveying both the Spider-Man-esque internal monologue and the dry wit of the post-credit line.",
        "**Visual-Audio Synchronization for Maximum Impact.** Each visual cue must have a corresponding audio element to reinforce the narrative. For example, Sharett's 'materialization' should be precisely timed with a phasing sound. The 'papers flying' montage needs sharp cuts synchronized to a rapid beat. Diplomatic maneuvers should have subtle sound design cues that suggest precision and influence.
