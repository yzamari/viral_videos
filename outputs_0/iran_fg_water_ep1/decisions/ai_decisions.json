The visual elements like exaggerated features, a cartoon map, and humorous scenarios are best conveyed through this style.

    "reasoning": "For YouTube, the lower third is a safe zone for text overlays like subtitles. Placing it bottom left avoids obscuring the main visual elements of the animated news report, such as the anchor or map, while ensuring readability. It's also a common and unobtrusive placement for informational text on YouTube.",
