    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For 'Extreme Value Theorem', visualize the dragon trying to reach the absolute highest pile of gold (max) or the lowest discarded rusty sword (min) within a specific cavern (closed interval)., For 'Derivative as instantaneous rate of change', show the dragon's flight path with a 'speedometer' on its neck displaying its velocity as it swoops down a cliff face., For 'Continuity and Differentiability', contrast the dragon's smooth flight path with a sudden 'teleport' or 'phase through a wall' moment, illustrating breaks and sharp turns.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The sheer volume of concepts (Extreme Value Theorem, uniform continuity, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor, derivatives, differentiability) packed into 35 seconds is a significant risk of feeling rushed and losing comedic timing or educational clarity.  The Heine-Cantor theorem might be the hardest to visually represent concisely within the comedic framework.",
      "The biggest concern is fitting all the specified mathematical concepts into 35 seconds without feeling overly rushed or sacrificing the comedic tone. Each concept needs a very brief, impactful visual and a one-liner explanation.",
      "The biggest challenge is ensuring each mathematical concept (Extreme Value Theorem, uniform continuity, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor, derivatives, differentiability/continuity) receives enough visual and comedic explanation within ~4-5 seconds each, without feeling rushed or oversimplified to the point of inaccuracy."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "For 'Extreme Value Theorem', visualize the dragon trying to reach the absolute highest pile of gold (max) or the lowest discarded rusty sword (min) within a specific cavern (closed interval).",
      "Script segments should be extremely brief, focusing on one visual gag or concept explanation per 1-2 sentence chunk. For Extreme Value Theorem, show the dragon diving for the absolute highest gold pile, then the lowest abandoned chest in a cave. For derivatives, use a speedometer on the dragon's neck during varied flight paths (steep climbs for high rates, gentle glides for low rates).",
      "Use quick cuts, exaggerated sound effects (like Wilhelm screams for failed treasure attempts or 'cha-chings' for discoveries), and the dragon's internal monologue for comedic effect.",
      "To demonstrate 'derivative as instantaneous rate of change,' visualize a speedometer on the dragon's chest as it flies, with a sharp spike showing its speed when accelerating down a slope towards a treasure chest, or its slow crawl up a mountain.",
      "Emphasize sound design with classic Family Guy-esque comedic stingers and exaggerated dragon sounds for dramatic or funny moments. Visually depict differentiability vs. continuity by showing a smooth dragon flight path that suddenly 'jitters' or 'skips' over a chasm, illustrating a break.",
      "To convey 'Monotonic Bijections', the dragon could follow a treasure map that consistently leads to *more* treasure with each step, and the map is never wrong.",
      "The 'Heine-Cantor Theorem' could be shown by the dragon consistently finding a predictable amount of gold from a treasure chest, no matter how it's opened or where it's found.",
      "For 'Derivative as instantaneous rate of change', show the dragon's flight path with a 'speedometer' on its neck displaying its velocity as it swoops down a cliff face.",
      "For 'Continuity and Differentiability', contrast the dragon's smooth flight path with a sudden 'teleport' or 'phase through a wall' moment, illustrating breaks and sharp turns.",
      "For 'Extreme Value Theorem,' show the dragon excitedly swooping to grab the highest stack of gold coins (max) in a cave and then dejectedly nudging the emptiest treasure chest (min) within a defined cavern boundary."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To make this Family Guy-style calculus comedy engaging for Instagram, we need to lean heavily into rapid visual gags and relatable, albeit absurd, treasure-hunting scenarios that explain the core concepts.  The dragon character's personality should drive the humor, with each mathematical concept framed as a slightly incompetent but ultimately successful treasure-hunting trick.",
      "To create an engaging Family Guy-style calculus comedy for Instagram, we must prioritize visual metaphors and rapid comedic beats that link treasure hunting to each mathematical concept. The dragon's personality should be central, using exaggerated reactions and absurd treasure-finding attempts to explain the core ideas concisely.",
      "To make this Family Guy-style calculus comedy engaging on Instagram, we must prioritize rapid-fire visual gags and concise explanations, anchoring the narrative with the dragon's treasure-hunting persona. Each mathematical concept needs a distinct, humorous visual metaphor directly tied to finding treasure, ensuring clarity and retention within the tight 35-second window."

  "key_insights": [
    "The 35-second duration demands a hyper-condensed approach. Focusing on a strong visual metaphor for each concept, tied directly to the dragon's treasure hunt, will maximize comprehension and retention for a general audience on Instagram.",
    "The tight 35-second timeframe on Instagram demands immediate visual hooks and humor. By framing complex calculus concepts within a familiar, comedic treasure-hunting narrative, we make them more accessible and entertaining for a general audience, increasing virality.",
    "The core challenge is distilling complex calculus into short, digestible comedic bits. Leveraging the dragon's character and treasure-hunting theme creates a strong, consistent visual language that makes abstract concepts more tangible and entertaining for a general Instagram audience."
