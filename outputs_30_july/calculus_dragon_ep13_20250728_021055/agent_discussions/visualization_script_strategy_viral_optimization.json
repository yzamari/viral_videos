The dragon's 'mood swings' for concavity will be key, perhaps visualized as him physically transforming or his lair changing dramatically with each derivative test. The viral potential hinges on the sheer absurdity of applying detective tropes to calculus, amplified by rapid-fire visual humor and relatable 'mood swings' representing mathematical behavior.",
