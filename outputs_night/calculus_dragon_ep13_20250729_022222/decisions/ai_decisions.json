    "reasoning": "Family Guy style comedy leans heavily into cartoon aesthetics. The request for animated title cards, epic effects, and visual metaphors like detective investigation and mood swings for concavity are all best expressed through a vibrant, exaggerated cartoon style. This style is highly engaging for a general audience on platforms like Instagram, making complex concepts like function analysis more accessible and entertaining.",

    "primary_overlay_position": "top_center",
    "positioning_strategy": "static",
    "reasoning": "The prompt specifies a 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD' at the beginning for 3 seconds. Placing this at the top center ensures maximum visibility for the title and fits the 'epic effects' requirement without obscuring the main visual action of the cartoon or interfering with potential lower-third content later in the video. For Instagram, avoiding the bottom 20% is a key constraint, making the top a safe and impactful choice.",

Create a Family Guy style comedy where dragon detective investigates functions completely. Teach systematic function analysis: finding domain, critical points, using first and second derivative tests, finding inflection points, asymptotes, and sketching curves. Use visual metaphors: detective investigation, solving cases, mood swings for concavity. Make the complete function investigation process entertaining and memorable.",
