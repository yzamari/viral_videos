Each concept requires a visual metaphor and a brief explanation, which can easily exceed the word count if not meticulously planned. The \"unknown duration\" needs to be resolved to a firm 30-40 seconds to ensure effective pacing and audience retention."

        "For the ratio/root tests, have the dragon try to 'catch' something that's growing too fast (divergence) or shrinking too slowly (convergence), using visual cues like growing vines or shrinking spells.",
