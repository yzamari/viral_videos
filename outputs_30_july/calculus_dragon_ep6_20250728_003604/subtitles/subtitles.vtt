Welcome to Sparky's Power-Up Workshop!

00:02.090 --> 00:02.508
Today,

00:02.808 --> 00:03.996
we master exponents.

00:03.996 --> 00:05.185
Imagine transforming a

00:05.485 --> 00:12.433
cute dragon into a fiery inferno

00:12.733 --> 00:15.581
using fractional powers - it is

00:15.881 --> 00:17.553
simply dividing the power-up!

00:17.553 --> 00:18.389
Real exponents

00:18.689 --> 00:19.960
are like infinite power-ups;

00:19.960 --> 00:20.596
we approach

00:20.896 --> 00:22.480
a number using limits.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.273
See the

00:23.573 --> 00:24.500
bubbles grow closer?

00:24.500 --> 00:25.427
Topology explores these

00:25.727 --> 00:26.006
spaces.

00:26.006 --> 00:27.121
Some points stand alone;

00:27.121 --> 00:27.399
others

00:27.699 --> 00:28.352
have boundaries.

00:28.352 --> 00:29.658
It is all about

00:29.958 --> 00:30.960
connections!

00:30.960 --> 00:35.967
This is the Cantor set,

00:36.267 --> 00:37.171
a fractal masterpiece, a perfect example
of infinity within limits.

00:37.171 --> 00:37.442
Mind blown, humans
