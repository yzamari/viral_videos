    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Optimize the animated title card for vertical viewing (9:16 aspect ratio) with bold, readable text. Ensure the 'epic effects' are short but impactful., For each test (ratio, root, comparison), create distinct, short segments. Integrate 'Family Guy'-esque humor and zero-gravity gags to explain the concepts visually, keeping each segment under 30 seconds for optimal Instagram Reels/Story performance., Use dynamic camera angles and quick cuts during the math demonstrations to maintain visual interest, mimicking the fast-paced comedy style.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The 'unknown duration' needs careful management; if the video becomes too long, viewers may drop off, negatively impacting algorithm performance. Segmenting into digestible chunks is key.",
      "The 'unknown duration' needs careful management; segmenting the content into distinct, highly engaging 15-30 second modules is crucial for maintaining audience retention and encouraging shares.",
      "The primary concern is making the math concepts universally understandable and funny without alienating viewers who aren't math enthusiasts. Visual clarity and comedic timing are paramount to avoid viewers scrolling past.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the humor and the educational aspect of the convergence tests. If the math explanation becomes too dense or the jokes fall flat, it could alienate viewers and reduce watch time.",
      "Ensuring the educational aspect remains clear amidst the comedy and visual effects might be challenging; balance is crucial."

      "Optimize the animated title card for vertical viewing (9:16 aspect ratio) with bold, readable text. Ensure the 'epic effects' are short but impactful.",
      "Create a highly shareable, meme-able clip focusing on one specific math test demonstration with a punchy joke and clear visual payoff. This will drive initial engagement and discoverability.",
      "For each test (ratio, root, comparison), create distinct, short segments. Integrate 'Family Guy'-esque humor and zero-gravity gags to explain the concepts visually, keeping each segment under 30 seconds for optimal Instagram Reels/Story performance.",
      "Implement short, impactful sound effects and character reactions during the zero-gravity math demonstrations to amplify the humor and visual appeal.",
      "Use trending audio or sound effects that fit the space comedy theme to further boost algorithm visibility and audience connection.  Incorporate short, punchy on-screen text overlays summarizing the key concept of each test.",
      "Design the animated title card with a bold, 'EPISODE 3: TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!' text that pops against a chaotic, colorful space backdrop, hinting at the Family Guy comedic style.",
      "Utilize Instagram's Reels features like text overlays for key math terms and quick cuts between visual explanations to maintain a fast-paced, engaging rhythm.",
      "For the ratio test as a space multiplication game, show the dragon rapidly multiplying rockets, with some exploding comically if the ratio is too high (divergent), and others landing neatly if it's within bounds (convergent).",
      "Craft catchy hooks for each segment's caption, encouraging viewers to 'watch till the end' to see the dragon's 'cosmic plant growth experiment' or 'rocket races'."

    "consensus_points": [
      "For this 'Family Guy' style space comedy about convergence tests, Instagram's algorithm thrives on short, punchy, visually dynamic content. Leverage the animated title card to immediately hook viewers, and ensure each math demonstration is a quick, humorous visual gag. The 'unknown duration' allows for flexibility, but breaking down each test into 15-30 second segments with clear subtitles will maximize watch time and engagement.",
      "To maximize engagement for this 'Family Guy' space math comedy on Instagram, we need to lean heavily into the visual humor and quick, digestible explanations of convergence tests.  The core message should be about making complex math fun and accessible through relatable, animated scenarios.",
      "For Instagram, the key to this Family Guy-style space math comedy is maximum visual punch and rapid-fire humor. We need to ensure the animated title card is a guaranteed click and the math concepts are instantly digestible through short, comical visual gags. Since the duration is unknown, each math test demonstration should be a self-contained, highly shareable micro-episode, ideally under 30 seconds."
