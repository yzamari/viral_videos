    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Craft visually distinct comic panels for each plot point, emphasizing quick cuts and bold graphics that pop on mobile screens. Use bold, easily readable text for key dialogue and on-screen captions, adhering strictly to the 1-2 sentence subtitle format to maintain readability., Employ a layered sound design strategy, with unique SFX for each action (morphing, WHOOSH, SNAP, SHOCK, CLANG) to enhance the cinematic feel and emotional impact of each transition. A dramatic, rising orchestral score will underscore the escalating tension, particularly towards the post-credit tease., Initiate with an 8-second 'origin' panel: Young Rabin, Star of David shield, then a rapid 8-second 'transformation' showing soldier-to-PM morphing with a distinct sound effect. Follow with an explosive 8-second Entebbe Rescue sequence, emphasizing 'COMMANDOS ASSEMBLE!' and a 'WHOOSH!' sky-drop. Then, a sharp 7-second 'Economic Crisis' with 'SNAP!' and visual dust-off, leading into an 8-second 'Scandal Reveal' with SHOCK effects and 'BETRAYAL!'. Conclude the main arc with an 8-second 'Resignation' featuring the shield CLANGING and 'I'll be back!'.",
