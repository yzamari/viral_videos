Each distinct action needs to be a short, visually impactful burst, precisely timed with its corresponding sound effect and a very brief on-screen text element, all within the 35-second limit.",

Each action \u2013 from the Knesset wall crash to the vanishing opposition \u2013 should be a punchy, 2-3 second segment with distinct sound effects and bold visuals. This pacing ensures we can fit all the described chaotic events into the 35-second window while maintaining high energy and clarity.",

The key is to maintain a relentless pace, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats with distinct, comic-book-style visual and sound effects that align with the political satire. Given the \u00b15% duration tolerance, precise segment timing is crucial to deliver the full narrative arc within the 33.25-36.75 second window.",
