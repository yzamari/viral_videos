  "mission_statement": "EPISODE 13: Dragon Detective Agency!! Show this as HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects! Create a Family Guy style comedy where dragon detective investigates functions completely. Teach systematic function analysis: finding domain, critical points, using first and second derivative tests, finding inflection points, asymptotes, and sketching curves. Use visual metaphors: detective investigation, solving cases, mood swings for concavity. Make the complete function investigation process entertaining and memorable.",
