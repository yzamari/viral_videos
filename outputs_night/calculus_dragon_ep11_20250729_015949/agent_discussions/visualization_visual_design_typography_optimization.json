The core of the video will be translating complex calculus concepts into relatable visual metaphors within the ninja training context, ensuring clarity and humor for an Instagram audience within the 40-second timeframe.",

The opening title card should explode with dynamic, fiery colors and sharp typography to signal epicness. Each calculus concept needs a unique visual metaphor, like a dragon struggling with an \"infinity/infinity\" scroll that's too big to unroll, or a secret \"0/0\" technique involving vanishing smoke.",

The core 40 seconds should translate complex calculus into highly animated ninja training sequences, using clear visual metaphors for indeterminate forms like 0/0 and infinity/infinity to maximize Instagram engagement.",
