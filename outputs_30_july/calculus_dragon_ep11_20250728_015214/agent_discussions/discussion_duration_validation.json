    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Utilize quick cuts between the dragon's ninja training and the visual representation of calculus problems (e.g., a '0/0' demon being sliced by a derivative sword)., Implement distinct sound effects for each calculus technique \u2013 perhaps a dramatic 'WHOOSH' for L'H\u00f4pital's rule, a mystical chime for Darboux theorem, and a comical 'boing' for advanced limit tricks., Allocate specific visual metaphors for each calculus technique: a scroll for Darboux Theorem, a split screen for L'H\u00f4pital's rule demonstrating the derivative process, and a 'stairway to infinity' for advanced limits.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting the explanation of Darboux theorem, L'H\u00f4pital's rule for multiple indeterminate forms, and advanced limit techniques into the extremely tight timeframe without sacrificing clarity or comedic impact. Each concept needs a distinct visual and dialogue snippet that can be quickly understood.",
      "The primary concern is fitting the explanation of Darboux theorem, L'H\u00f4pital's rule, and advanced limit techniques into an 'Unknown Duration' that must adhere to the 35-second \u00b15% target without sacrificing clarity or humor. Overly complex explanations will alienate the audience.",
      "The primary concern is cramming multiple advanced calculus concepts (Darboux, L'H\u00f4pital's rule for multiple forms, advanced limits) into a tightly controlled 35-second window without sacrificing clarity or comedic impact."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Allocate roughly 8-10 seconds for introducing the scenario (baby dragon, ninja dojo) and the 'secret calculus scroll'. Then, dedicate 7-8 seconds to demonstrating L'H\u00f4pital's rule for 0/0 with a visual gag (e.g., dragon trying to divide zero by zero, Master Ninja shows the 'secret derivative' technique), followed by another 7-8 seconds for infinity/infinity, and the final 10-12 seconds for Darboux Theorem/advanced limits, culminating in an 'ultimate technique' payoff.",
      "Allocate specific visual metaphors for each calculus technique: a scroll for Darboux Theorem, a split screen for L'H\u00f4pital's rule demonstrating the derivative process, and a 'stairway to infinity' for advanced limits.",
      "Utilize quick cuts between the dragon's ninja training and the visual representation of calculus problems (e.g., a '0/0' demon being sliced by a derivative sword).",
      "Ensure the pacing mimics a 'training montage' where each success (or failure) with a calculus problem is a short, punchy scene with immediate visual feedback.",
      "Implement distinct sound effects for each calculus technique \u2013 perhaps a dramatic 'WHOOSH' for L'H\u00f4pital's rule, a mystical chime for Darboux theorem, and a comical 'boing' for advanced limit tricks.",
      "For L'H\u00f4pital's Rule, a visual could be the dragon attempting to split a single glowing ember (representing zero) into zero pieces, leading to chaos. The master then reveals the 'split-derivative' scroll, showing how to differentiate the numerator and denominator separately to resolve the paradox."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To make this Family Guy-style calculus comedy engaging on Instagram, we need rapid-fire visual gags synced with snappy dialogue that explains complex concepts humorously. The core challenge is balancing the educational content with the comedic timing inherent in the 'Family Guy' style and the fast-paced nature of Instagram.",
      "For this Family Guy-style calculus comedy, we must translate complex math into rapid-fire visual gags mirroring ninja training. Each calculus concept needs a distinct 'ultimate technique' visual, like a dragon performing a 'Darboux Double Derivative' move. This visual storytelling is key to making the educational content digestible and hilarious within Instagram's fast-paced environment.",
      "To synchronize the comedic Family Guy-style narrative with the specific calculus concepts (Darboux theorem, L'H\u00f4pital's rule) and visual metaphors (ninja training, secret scrolls) for Instagram, we need to map each math technique to a distinct, punchy ninja move or training sequence. The pacing must ensure that the visual gag and the core concept are delivered within segments that allow for rapid succession, keeping engagement high within the 35-second target."

  "key_insights": [
    "Instagram favors short, punchy content. The 'Family Guy' style allows for irreverent humor, which is perfect for simplifying calculus. My audio-centric approach prioritizes clear vocal delivery and sound design to enhance comedic beats and ensure the calculus explanations are comprehensible despite the rapid pacing.",
    "The core challenge is marrying the intellectual rigor of calculus with the chaotic, visual humor of Family Guy for a short-form platform. Visual metaphors are essential to anchor abstract concepts to tangible, comedic actions.",
    "Ensuring all elements\u2014comedy, calculus, visual metaphors, and platform constraints\u2014are tightly coordinated is crucial for a successful outcome. This approach prioritizes the holistic delivery of the complex brief."
