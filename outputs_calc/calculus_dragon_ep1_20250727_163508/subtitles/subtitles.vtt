00:00.000 --> 00:02.847
Hey kids, I am Epsilon the Dragon!

00:02.847 --> 00:04.396
Let us explore number sets.

00:04.396 --> 00:04.706
POOF!

00:04.706 --> 00:05.016
Natural

00:05.016 --> 00:05.825
numbers, one, two, three, appear as
counting

00:05.825 --> 00:09.035
cookies for my dragon treats!

00:09.035 --> 00:10.318
But wait,

00:10.318 --> 00:12.445
zero appears - I am special!

00:12.445 --> 00:12.800
Negative

00:12.800 --> 00:17.319
numbers arrive as ice one, minus two,

00:17.319 --> 00:17.991
minus three.

00:17.991 --> 00:19.334
Together, we are integers!

00:19.334 --> 00:19.670
WHOOSH!

00:19.670 --> 00:20.872
Fractions fly in as pizza ,
three-quarters.

00:20.872 --> 00:23.954
We are rational numbers - any fraction!

00:23.954 --> 00:26.514
The square root of two appears as

00:26.514 --> 00:28.589
an infinite spiral dragon.

00:28.589 --> 00:30.145
I am irrational

00:30.145 --> 00:32.403
- my decimal never repeats!

00:32.403 --> 00:33.306
Pi flies

00:33.306 --> 00:35.153
by, leaving an infinite trail.

00:35.153 --> 00:35.892
They form

00:35.892 --> 00:37.146
the real number line.

00:37.146 --> 00:38.087
Absolute value measures

00:38.087 --> 00:43.572
distance from zero, like dragon hugs,
always

00:43.572 --> 00:44.173
positive!

00:44.173 --> 00:47.778
Intervals are dragon territories - some

00:47.778 --> 00:49.849
include endpoints, others do not.

00:49.849 --> 00:50.678
Bounded sets

00:50.678 --> 00:52.027
have limits, like a dragon playpen.

00:52.027 --> 00:54.727
For any epsilon greater than zero, we can
get closer than epsilon
