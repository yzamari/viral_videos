The visual elements, particularly the animated map and character portrayals, must be executed with a distinct, exaggerated style to maximize comedic impact and reinforce the 'ghosting' narrative.  Emphasis will be placed on the audio-visual sync, ensuring the dialogue and on-screen action are perfectly timed for maximum comedic effect and to adhere to the strict 60-second duration.",
