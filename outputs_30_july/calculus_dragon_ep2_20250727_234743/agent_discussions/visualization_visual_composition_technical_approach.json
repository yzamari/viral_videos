Prioritizing rapid-fire explanations of each mathematical concept (convergence, epsilon-delta, unique limit, bounded, arithmetic of limits, squeeze theorem) within distinct visual gags will be key for the 35-second runtime.",

Each of the six core mathematical concepts needs a distinct, rapid-fire visual gag within its allotted 5-7 second segment, building momentum towards the 35-second runtime.  The visual metaphors, like 'epsilon tunnels' and 'safety rails,' are crucial for immediate comprehension and comedic impact.",
