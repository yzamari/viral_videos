00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,813
Welcome to Smooth Dragon Flights, where
calculus takes flight!

2
00:00:04,113 --> 00:00:05,759
We do not teleport;

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:07,653
we fly smoothly.

4
00:00:07,953 --> 00:00:12,237
We approach our destination with
precision, like approaching a limit.

5
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:15,044
Limits must agree from all directions.

6
00:00:15,344 --> 00:00:18,793
Smooth flying means a successful landing
from any approach.

7
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:21,679
Continuous flight means no sudden stops;

8
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:23,990
our flight path is unbroken.

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,339
If our flight path connects smoothly, we
always reach our destination.

10
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:30,598
This is continuity in action
