        "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Segment the narrative into 8 distinct visual and audio cues, dedicating approximately 8 seconds per segment to achieve the target 64 seconds. For example, dedicating the initial seconds to the 'high-tech flowers blooming from ancient desert sand' and Peres's posture, then transitioning to the 'colorful birds carrying startup ideas' with a subtle sound effect., Emphasize sonic details for the 'Studio Ghibli magic': use ethereal chimes for blooming flowers, soft fluttering for birds, and a gentle, warm glow for the 'bridges of light.' The Dimona reactor's sound should be a low, hum of peaceful energy, not industrial. The 'origami cranes' transformation can have a crisp, paper-folding sound. The final 'robots dancing the hora' should have a playful, upbeat synthesized tune blending with traditional instrumentation., For dialogue, keep each sentence short (around 10-15 words) and delivered with a calm, inspiring tone, mimicking Peres's wisdom. Each spoken segment should ideally be no more than two sentences to ensure subtitles are easily readable and sync perfectly with visual changes. For instance, DIALOGUE: 'From ancient sands, dreams take flight.' followed by [VISUAL: Colorful birds carrying startup ideas across the sky].",
        "key_considerations": [
          "The primary concern is ensuring that the complex, symbolic imagery described (high-tech flowers, startup birds, bridges of light, dancing robots) can be rendered with a consistent Ghibli-esque aesthetic within the tight editing constraints of TikTok, without appearing cluttered or rushed.",
          "The main concern is balancing the detailed, metaphorical imagery (e.g., Dimona reactor glowing with peaceful atomic energy, peace agreements as origami cranes) with the rapid-fire nature of TikTok and the limited time per segment to convey meaning.",
          "The primary concern is maintaining the exact 64-second duration \u00b15%. Given the rich narrative, precise pacing and trimming of dialogue and visuals for each of the 8 segments will be paramount. Each segment must contribute to the overall flow without feeling rushed or prolonged.",
          "Ensuring the complex narrative of 'old and new Israel,' 'peace agreements,' and specific technological elements like the 'Dimona reactor' are conveyed with the simplicity and wonder characteristic of Ghibli, without becoming too literal or complex for a short TikTok format, is a key concern.
