        "Utilize dramatic, comic-book style sound effects (e.g., 'POW!', 'THWACK!') for key moments and transitions, synced perfectly with on-screen action.",

        "Incorporate visual elements reminiscent of comic panels or superhero movie trailers, using dynamic text overlays and impactful imagery.",
