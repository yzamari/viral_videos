    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate 6-8 seconds per major action panel, ensuring critical sound effects (BOOM, SNAP, KA-POW) are perfectly timed with visual cues and voiceovers like 'I am... INEVITABLE!' for maximum impact. Utilize shorter durations (3-5 seconds) for montage and tech panels to maintain momentum, ensuring the entire sequence fits within the 61.75-68.25 second window., Employ a distinct, authoritative voice for the main narration and teaser lines, contrasted with a slightly more thoughtful tone for the 'Finally, peace.' thought bubble, ensuring emotional resonance. The 'True Believer Achievement' line should be delivered with a triumphant, definitive tone to solidify the narrative., Employ a single voice actor with a versatile range, capable of delivering the 'inevitable' declaration with gravitas, the 'finally, peace' with a touch of dry humor, and the final teaser with authority. The voice should have a slight echo or reverb to enhance the comic book feel.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is ensuring all 8 distinct narrative segments, including the plot twist and editor's note, are clearly presented and readable within their allocated rapid-fire time slots, especially the longer 'Editor's note box' content, without compromising the overall pacing or visual clarity.",
      "Maintaining audio clarity and impact for the crucial speech and thought bubbles amidst the high volume of sound effects and music requires careful mixing and mastering. Over-saturation could lead to essential text being missed by the viewer.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring seamless transitions between the various voice actors and sound effects without any audible overlap or dead air, which could disrupt the meticulously timed flow and exceed the 65-second limit."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Assign a bold, authoritative voice actor for 'I AM... INEVITABLE!' and a more reflective, perhaps slightly weary tone for 'Finally, peace.' The main narrator should have an energetic, classic comic book announcer style, peaking in intensity during action sequences.",
      "Segment the 65 seconds into roughly 8-10 distinct audio chunks, allocating 6-8 seconds for primary action panels and 3-5 seconds for montage/tech panels, ensuring all key phrases and sound effects are integrated seamlessly within these precise time blocks.",
      "Utilize a layered audio approach: a foundational energetic background music track (think cinematic comic score), sharp, distinct Foley for every 'BOOM,' 'SNAP,' 'KA-POW,' and 'WHOOSH,' and then precisely timed voiceover segments that never overlap with critical sound effects.",
      "Employ a distinct, authoritative voice for the main narration and teaser lines, contrasted with a slightly more thoughtful tone for the 'Finally, peace.' thought bubble, ensuring emotional resonance. The 'True Believer Achievement' line should be delivered with a triumphant, definitive tone to solidify the narrative.",
      "Employ a single voice actor with a versatile range, capable of delivering the 'inevitable' declaration with gravitas, the 'finally, peace' with a touch of dry humor, and the final teaser with authority. The voice should have a slight echo or reverb to enhance the comic book feel.",

    "consensus_points": [
      "To achieve the 'Marvel Comics opening' mission within 65 seconds on Instagram, we will meticulously synchronize high-impact comic book sound effects (BOOM, SNAP, KA-POW, WHOOSH) with dynamic panel visuals and concise, punchy voiceovers, mirroring a rapid-fire comic narrative. This approach prioritizes visual-auditory synergy, ensuring each key moment, from Ben-Gurion's emergence to the final editor's note, is impactful and clearly conveyed, driving engagement through a fast-paced, visually stimulating experience.",
      "To achieve the 'Marvel Comics opening' mission on Instagram within 65 seconds, we will strategically pair high-impact, rapid-fire comic visuals with a dynamic voiceover and distinct sound effects.
