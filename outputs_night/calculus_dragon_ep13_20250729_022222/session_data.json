  "mission": "EPISODE 13: Dragon Detective Agency!! Show this as HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects! Create a Family Guy style comedy where dragon detective investigates functions completely. Teach systematic function analysis: finding domain, critical points, using first and second derivative tests, finding inflection points, asymptotes, and sketching curves. Use visual metaphors: detective investigation, solving cases, mood swings for concavity. Make the complete function investigation process entertaining and memorable.",

Today, we crack the case of the crazy curve. [VISUAL: The dragon points a magnifying glass at the graph's x-axis. Text overlays show 'Domain: All Real Numbers'.] DIALOGUE: First, we check the domain, the suspects' possible hiding spots. [VISUAL: The dragon finds peaks and valleys on the graph, marking them as 'Critical Points'. An animation shows 'Derivative Test 1: Ups/Downs'.] DIALOGUE: Next, critical points reveal mood swings, using the first derivative test for direction. [VISUAL: The dragon analyzes the curve's bend, showing 'Concavity' and 'Inflection Points'. An animation shows 'Derivative Test 2: Curve Ball!'.] DIALOGUE: The second derivative test uncovers hidden curves and inflection points, the plot twists! [VISUAL: The dragon draws the complete sketched curve, highlighting asymptotes. Final shot of the dragon looking satisfied.] DIALOGUE: With all clues gathered, we sketch the curve, including asymptotes, solving the case for good!",
