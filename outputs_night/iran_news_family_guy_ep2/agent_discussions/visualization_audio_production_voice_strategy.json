The vocal delivery for Maryam should be urgent but controlled, contrasting with the comically exaggerated Stewie-style minister.  Sharp, almost jarring sound effects for the graphics will punctuate the visual gags and ensure we hit the precise 40-second mark.",

The viral potential lies in the relatable absurdity of the content, amplified by sharp editing and a punchy audio design that mirrors the escalating chaos.",
