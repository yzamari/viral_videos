    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Utilize a 'split-panel' effect or rapid succession of distinct, highly stylized comic panels for each major narrative beat, ensuring each event, from the glowing cigarette to the exploding internet, is visually distinct and impactful., Employ a consistent visual motif of 'power emanating' from Golda Meir throughout, whether through glowing effects, exaggerated character posing, or dramatic lighting shifts, to reinforce her agency and influence across all scenarios., Utilize a 'split-screen' or 'wipe' transition between panels to maintain visual momentum and mimic comic book page turns, enhancing the visual storytelling.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is ensuring the rapid pacing doesn't dilute the historical context or emotional impact of each panel, especially the 'YOM KIPPUR WAR' and the 'resignation' panel's mushroom cloud. We must balance speed with sufficient visual and auditory cues to convey these weighty moments effectively.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring that the rapid pacing doesn't lead to viewer confusion or a loss of the narrative's emotional weight. Each panel needs to land its message effectively without being rushed.",
      "The primary concern is the sheer density of narrative elements within the 65-second timeframe, which could lead to information overload or a superficial treatment of critical historical moments if not executed with extreme precision in pacing and visual clarity."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Employ custom-designed comic book lettering and speech bubbles for all dialogue and key text to reinforce the Marvel aesthetic and ensure readability.",
      "Incorporate a subtle, recurring visual motif, such as the glowing cigarette or a specific color palette, to unify the diverse panel sequences.",
      "Employ a consistent visual motif of 'power emanating' from Golda Meir throughout, whether through glowing effects, exaggerated character posing, or dramatic lighting shifts, to reinforce her agency and influence across all scenarios.",

      "Utilize a 'split-screen' or 'wipe' transition between panels to maintain visual momentum and mimic comic book page turns, enhancing the visual storytelling.",
      "For 'Kitchen diplomacy', employ a jarring, downward pitch-shifted sound effect as world leaders shrink, coupled with a visual cue of them becoming comically small and subservient, to underscore Golda's intimidating presence and influence.",
      "Visually represent the 'intelligence failure' and 'ignored warnings' with a rapid montage of rapidly flashing documents and a distorted, echoing 'error' sound effect to emphasize the critical oversight. This will be synchronized with a sharp 'SNAP!' sound to punctuate the realization of the intelligence failure.",
      "For the 'intelligence failure' and 'time rewind' panels, use rapid visual cues like flickering screens or distorted imagery overlaid with appropriate sound effects to convey the message quickly."
