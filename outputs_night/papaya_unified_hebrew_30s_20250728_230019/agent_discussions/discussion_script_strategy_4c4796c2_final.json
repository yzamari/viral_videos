    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For maximum TikTok engagement, the initial Marvel-style hero entrance should be extremely dramatic with powerful sound effects, lasting only about 4-5 seconds. Immediately transition to whimsical Ghibli sounds and soft lighting for the enchanted forest/Grandma scene, emphasizing a magical, healing vibe. The 'reality check' needs a sharp, comedic sound effect to punctuate the shift, and the night scene should burst with upbeat, trending music for the party atmosphere., The 'drunk guy's' order should be timed perfectly within the party scene, around the 25-second mark, to deliver the funniest twist. Ensure the Hebrew slogan is punchy and memorable, delivered with energetic clarity at the end, followed by the business details clearly displayed and spoken., For viral potential, ensure the 'hero entrance' and 'Ghibli transformation' are visually stunning and cut very quickly to the 'reality check' to create a 'wait, what?' moment, followed by the energetic night scene that feels like a natural progression.",

      "The biggest concern is fitting all these distinct visual and auditory style shifts \u2013 Marvel, Ghibli, reality, and party \u2013 into a coherent 32-second narrative without it feeling rushed or disjointed. Each transition must be visually and audibly distinct yet flow smoothly.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all these distinct stylistic and narrative elements into the 32-second timeframe without any segment feeling rushed or the transitions being jarring. Each audio cue needs to be incredibly precise to land the comedic timing and maintain the ad's overall flow.",

      "For the Marvel hero entrance, use a dramatic, orchestral sting and a 'thud' sound effect as the hero crashes through. For the Ghibli transformation, transition to a light, enchanting harp or glockenspiel melody and a soft, ethereal pad. The reality cut needs a sudden, almost anticlimactic 'boing' or 'deflating balloon' sound to emphasize the comedic shift. The night scene should launch into an upbeat, trending electronic track with clear highs for vocals.",
      "The drunk guy's line needs to be delivered with perfect comedic timing, making it the peak of the humor before the clear, catchy Hebrew slogan that reinforces the brand's message.",
      "The drunk guy's line needs a slightly slurred, but still understandable delivery, layered over the party music, perhaps with a subtle reverb to emphasize his 'out of it' state. The final Hebrew slogan should be delivered clearly and confidently, possibly with a slight echo effect or a catchy jingle to make it stick. The business details at the end should be clear and crisp, possibly with a subtle sonic logo or sting."
