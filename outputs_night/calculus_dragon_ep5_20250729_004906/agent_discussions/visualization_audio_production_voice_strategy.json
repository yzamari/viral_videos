The 3-second title card demands a powerful soundscape, blending roaring dragon effects with sharp, glitchy math-inspired sounds to instantly capture attention on Instagram. The dragon's coaching voice should be distinct and fast-paced, mirroring the Family Guy humor, with sound effects strategically placed to punctuate visual gags and mathematical demonstrations.",

The 3-second title card must be visually explosive, setting a high-energy tone, while the subsequent 37 seconds should seamlessly blend comedic synchronized swimming mishaps with understandable visual aids for Cauchy sequences and epsilon distance.  Prioritize dynamic editing and punchy dialogue for that Family Guy-esque humor to ensure high retention.",

The subsequent 37 seconds require rapid pacing, sharp comedic timing, and clear visual representations of mathematical concepts like epsilon distance and Cauchy sequences through exaggerated synchronized swimming gags to capture audience attention.  The key is to blend Family Guy-style humor with digestible mathematical explanations, prioritizing visual storytelling.",
