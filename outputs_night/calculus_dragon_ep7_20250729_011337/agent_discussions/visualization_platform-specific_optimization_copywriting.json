Each function concept needs to be distilled into a 1-2 sentence, impactful dialogue paired with a visually hilarious and metaphorically relevant animation, ensuring subtitles are perfectly timed for the 10-15 word count. The \"Unknown Duration\" necessitates a consistent pace and recurring visual gags that encourage rewatches, a key metric for the algorithm.",
