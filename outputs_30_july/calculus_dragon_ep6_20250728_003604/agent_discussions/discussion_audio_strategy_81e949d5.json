For real exponents, a visual of the dragon 'stretching' infinitely towards a glowing treat when approaching a limit will be key.",

Think Stewie Griffin with a touch more unhinged enthusiasm. For specific punchlines or moments of absurdity, a deep, gruff voice (like Peter Griffin) could briefly interject.",
        "**Audio Approach:** Utilize extremely short, punchy dialogue segments (1-2 sentences max). Pair each dialogue line with a distinct sound effect or musical sting that emphasizes the comedic beat or the mathematical concept. This creates an auditory rhythm that complements the rapid visual changes.",
        "**Sound Design:** Incorporate cartoonish sound effects for visual gags (boings, splats, pops, magical twinkles). Use a subtle, underlying comedic score that swells during comedic moments. For 'power transformations,' think dramatic orchestral stings followed by silly cartoon sounds. For topology, use 'bubble zone' pops and 'gathering' chaos sounds.",
