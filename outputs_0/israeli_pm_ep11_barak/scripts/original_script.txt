Behold Ehud Barak, Israel's most decorated soldier. His medals gleam like Infinity Stones. They called him Israel's smartest Prime Minister. His intellect pulsed, a Mind Stone glow. At Camp David, he offered a deal. Like Doctor Strange, he saw all futures. But Arafat refused every timeline. Then the Second Intifada exploded like a Hulk rampage. He once operated dressed as a woman. He understood gender fluidity long before it was cool. His coalition crumbled faster than Thanos snapped his fingers. Victory vanished like dust. He lost to Sharon in a landslide. The biggest defeat ever seen. Later, on Epstein's island, he quipped: 'I kept my underwear on!' Now, he watches from above.
