    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate 6-8 seconds for the MIT graduation, ensuring crisp, perfect English with underlying 'swagger' in the vocal delivery, synched with a subtle 'power-up' sound for 'MR. SECURITY'., Dedicate 5-7 seconds to the election panel, with a sharp, decisive 'NARROW VICTORY!' sound effect and a confident vocal, visually representing the slim margin., Allocate 8-10 seconds for the Western Wall tunnel opening, creating a dramatic 'WHOOSH' and chaotic ambient sounds for 'PORTAL TO CHAOS,' with a distinct 'dissolving' effect for the peace process, evoking a cinematic feel.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Achieving seamless transitions between drastically different emotional states and narrative segments (e.g., from triumphant victory to chaotic disaster to personal rage) within very short time blocks will be challenging and requires careful orchestration of audio and visual elements.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the precise timing for each short segment to fit within the 65-second overall duration. Overly long dialogue or sound effects in any single panel could disrupt the pacing and potentially exceed the audio budget for other crucial moments.",
      "Maintaining visual coherence and rapid transitions between distinct narrative segments on Instagram without appearing jarring or disjointed is a critical challenge, as each panel must seamlessly flow into the next to build the overall story arc effectively.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the precise timing for each narrative beat to fit within the 65-second limit, as any segment running over could compromise the overall flow and impact of the 'Marvel Comics origin' narrative. Achieving the exact emotional tone for each distinct panel, from swagger to rage to determination, within these tight timeframes requires meticulous audio mixing and voice direction.",
      "The primary concern is maintaining the tight 65-second duration while ensuring all key narrative points and emotional shifts are conveyed with clarity and impact, requiring extremely precise timing of every audio element and visual cut to avoid rushing or losing coherence."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Allocate 8-10 seconds for the Western Wall tunnel opening, creating a dramatic 'WHOOSH' and chaotic ambient sounds for 'PORTAL TO CHAOS,' with a distinct 'dissolving' effect for the peace process, evoking a cinematic feel.",
      "Prioritize distinct vocal characterization for each 'panel,' from the confident MIT graduate to the enraged 'Hulk Sara,' using subtle pitch and tone shifts to enhance emotional resonance and differentiate narrative beats within the tight timeframe.",
      "Allocate 6-8 seconds for the MIT graduation, ensuring crisp, perfect English with underlying 'swagger' in the vocal delivery, synched with a subtle 'power-up' sound for 'MR. SECURITY'.",
      "Ensure all dialogue segments are kept to 1-2 sentences, with approximately 10-15 words per sentence to facilitate clear, readable subtitles and natural speech rhythm, maintaining the fast-paced comic book feel.",
      "For 'HULK SARA SMASH!', the voiceover must be a sharp, aggressive yell, synched with a distinct visual 'smash' effect and a loud sound effect, maximizing the impact of the scandal montage.",
      "Implement a layered audio approach where background music subtly shifts in intensity and style to match the mood of each panel (e.g., heroic fanfare for 'MR. SECURITY,' chaotic ambient for the tunnel opening, aggressive beats for 'Hulk Sara Smash!'), reinforcing the visual storytelling and contributing to the overall Marvel-esque feel.",
      "Dedicate 5-7 seconds to the election panel, with a sharp, decisive 'NARROW VICTORY!' sound effect and a confident vocal, visually representing the slim margin.",
      "Condense the scandal montage into 7-9 seconds using rapid cuts and distinct sound cues: cigar puff, champagne pop, and a forceful 'HULK SARA SMASH!' sound with a highly aggressive vocal.",
      "Allocate approximately 6-7 seconds for the MIT graduation panel, focusing on a confident, clear 'perfect English' delivery with a subtle, energetic underscore. The 'MR. SECURITY' glow should be accompanied by a distinct, rising power-up sound effect, and the 'CHEST BEAM' by a sharp, energetic 'zap' or 'discharge' sound.",
      "Dedicate 5-7 seconds to the election panel, using a triumphant, sharp sting for 'NARROW VICTORY!' and a quick, impactful 'whoosh' sound to visually emphasize the 1% margin. The 'PORTAL TO CHAOS' at the Western Wall tunnel opening needs 8-10 seconds, featuring a dramatic 'WHOOSH', unsettling ambient tones, and a distinct 'dissolving' sound effect for the peace process, complemented by subtle particle effects.",
      "Allocate 5-7 seconds for the landslide loss, focusing on a defeated yet defiant vocal for 'I'LL BE BACK!' over a somber soundscape that transitions to a determined beat.",
      "Assign 6-8 seconds to the coalition collapse and 'DISBANDING!' sequence, featuring abrupt audio shifts from heroic themes to fragmented sounds, visually showing heroes scattering.",
      "Conclude with 4-5 seconds for the mirror practice panel, emphasizing determined ambition with a 'LONGEST SERVING!' voiceover and a subtle, ascending musical motif, followed by a 1-2 second post-credit tease with a final impactful sound."
