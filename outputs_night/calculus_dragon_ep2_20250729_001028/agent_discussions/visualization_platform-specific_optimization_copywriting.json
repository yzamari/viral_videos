The visual representations of mathematical concepts, like the merging parallel tracks for the Squeeze Theorem, need to be incredibly clear and impactful, even on a small screen, to maximize click-through and watch time. We need to ensure the jokes and explanations are integrated seamlessly with these visuals to create an unforgettable, shareable educational experience.",
