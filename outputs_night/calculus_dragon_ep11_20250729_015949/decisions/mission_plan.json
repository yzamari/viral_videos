Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon in ninja dojo learns secret calculus techniques. Teach Darboux theorem, L'H\u00f4pital's rule for various indeterminate forms, and advanced limit techniques. Use visual metaphors: ninja training, secret scrolls, ultimate techniques. Show how to handle 0/0, infinity/infinity, and other indeterminate forms with humor and clarity.",
