[VISUAL: Baby dragon, Stewie Griffin-esque, in a suit, trips on a single stair.] DIALOGUE: Stewie's stuck on infinite stairs, realizing he is climbing a monotonic sequence. [VISUAL: Stewie enters a time loop, repeatedly saying 'What the hell?'] DIALOGUE: He gets stuck in time loops, his recursive sequences repeating endlessly. [VISUAL: Stewie tries to hold the number E, it keeps shrinking.] DIALOGUE: He learns about number 'e' and nested intervals, like shrinking Russian dolls. [VISUAL: Stewie sees a tiny dragon in a vast stairwell.] DIALOGUE: Subsequences appear, tiny versions of the journey, hinting at Bolzano-Weierstrass. [VISUAL: Stewie sits on a bounded, ever-decreasing stair.] DIALOGUE: A bounded monotonic sequence must converge, even if the stairs never end!
