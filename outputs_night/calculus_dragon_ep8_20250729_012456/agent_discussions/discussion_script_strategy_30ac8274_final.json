    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate ~5 seconds per concept: Epsilon-delta (precise flight through a narrow gap), one-sided limits (landing from specific directions), continuity (unbroken flight path), discontinuities (sudden teleportation/crash), IVT (smooth altitude change to hit a target)., Employ a Family Guy-esque narrator with quick wit, interjecting sarcastic commentary on the dragon's flying 'errors' to reinforce the humor and math points., Dedicate the initial 3 seconds to a visually spectacular, over-the-top 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' title card with booming dragon roars and epic orchestral stings to grab attention immediately, setting a comedic tone.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting all the outlined mathematical concepts (epsilon-delta, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity conditions, discontinuities, IVT) into the remaining 35-39 seconds after the title card. This may require simplifying the explanations to their absolute core, focusing on one key visual metaphor per concept and potentially omitting the Cauchy criterion if time is too tight without sacrificing clarity.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring each complex mathematical concept (epsilon-delta, Cauchy criterion, IVT) is conveyed with sufficient clarity and comedic impact within its allotted 5-7 second segment, without feeling overly rushed or sacrificing the humor.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the mathematical concepts into the extremely limited runtime after the 3-second title card without sacrificing clarity or comedic timing, which will require ruthless scripting and animation efficiency."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Allocate ~5 seconds per concept: Epsilon-delta (precise flight through a narrow gap), one-sided limits (landing from specific directions), continuity (unbroken flight path), discontinuities (sudden teleportation/crash), IVT (smooth altitude change to hit a target).",
      "Visually represent the epsilon-delta definition as a dragon attempting to navigate an impossibly narrow canyon (delta) to reach a specific landing pad, with even the slightest deviation (epsilon) causing it to crash comically. For continuity, showcase smooth, unbroken flight paths between landmarks, contrasting sharply with 'teleporting' dragon pilot errors for discontinuities.",
      "Craft the epsilon-delta definition as a dragon meticulously trying to land in a tiny target zone, with tiny wind gusts (epsilon) forcing it to adjust its path (delta), contrasting with a 'teleporting' dragon that misses entirely. Use tight zoom and quick cuts for impact.",
      "Dedicate the initial 3 seconds to a visually spectacular, over-the-top 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' title card with booming dragon roars and epic orchestral stings to grab attention immediately, setting a comedic tone.",
      "Employ a Family Guy-esque narrator with quick wit, interjecting sarcastic commentary on the dragon's flying 'errors' to reinforce the humor and math points.",
      "Represent continuity with a dragon smoothly gliding through a series of hoops without ever stopping or jumping, while discontinuities are shown by the dragon 'teleporting' or crashing through hoops, accompanied by comical sound effects and the pilot exclaiming 'Whoops! Lost connection!'."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To make 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' engaging on Instagram, we must prioritize rapid-fire comedic visual metaphors of dragon flight to explain each math concept intuitively within 5-7 second segments. The key is to leverage sound design for exaggerated humor, like teleporting mishaps, to boost virality and viewer retention.",
      "To maximize engagement for 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' on Instagram within 40 seconds, we must prioritize extremely rapid, visually distinct comedic flight analogies for each math concept, ensuring the Family Guy-style humor lands immediately. The key is to use the initial 3-second title card to grab attention, then dedicate roughly 5-7 seconds per concept, focusing on one punchy visual gag and a single line of dialogue.",
      "To maximize engagement for 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' on Instagram, we must deliver each math concept through ultra-fast, visually comedic flight analogies within strict 5-7 second segments. This requires relentless focus on punchy dialogue, exaggerated sound effects mimicking Family Guy humor, and immediate visual payoff for each concept, ensuring the core idea is grasped before the next segment arrives."

    "Instagram's short-form nature demands immediate visual impact and humor. By front-loading the epic title card and then delivering each math concept with a distinct, punchy flight analogy and sound effect, we create a highly digestible and memorable learning experience that aligns with viral content patterns.",
    "This approach ensures all required mathematical concepts are addressed within the tight timeframe, with a strong emphasis on visual storytelling and humor, which are crucial for Instagram's fast-paced consumption and the Family Guy style.",
    "The 40-second duration, including the 3-second title card, necessitates an extremely efficient script that prioritizes visual clarity and humor over in-depth explanation, aligning with Instagram's fast consumption patterns."
