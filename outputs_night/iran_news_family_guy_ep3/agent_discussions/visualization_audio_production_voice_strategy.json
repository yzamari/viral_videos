The audio needs to mirror the show's frantic pacing with distinct character voices for Maryam, Peter, and Quagmire, punctuated by exaggerated sound effects for the economic collapse visuals.  The voice strategy should focus on authentic imitations to capture the Family Guy essence and enhance the satirical humor.",
