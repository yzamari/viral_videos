1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,944
Baby dragon with a rocket pack!

2
00:00:01,944 --> 00:00:04,703
Let us explore the crazy limits

3
00:00:04,703 --> 00:00:05,415
of mathematics!

4
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:06,839
Behold, the dragon shrinks!

5
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,832
The Nth root of N approaches

6
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:09,088
one.

7
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:09,600
Magic stabilization!

8
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,368
Zoom to infinity!

9
00:00:10,368 --> 00:00:11,264
Some sequences extend forever.

10
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:11,711
Divergence, in

11
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,847
the extended sense, is quite spectacular.

12
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,975
The ratio your neighbors.

13
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,039
See the

14
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,320
dragon plants sprout and grow.

15
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,576
If

16
00:00:18,576 --> 00:00:20,591
the ratio is less than one,

17
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:21,559
we converge.

18
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,495
Epsilon chicks multiply rapidly,

19
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:24,839
showcasing divergence.

20
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,527
Limits help us understand

21
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,247
the infinite.

22
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:29,687
The tiny dragon, flames

23
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:34,823
sputtering, bravely navigates the
boundless expanse.

24
00:00:34,823 --> 00:00:38,759
Its rocket pack hisses, a miniature

25
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,064
symphony of controlled chaos.

26
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:42,216
The shrinking

27
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:47,231
spell casts a shimmering, iridescent glow.

28
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:50,975
Mathematical concepts unfold before us,
visualized

29
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:54,036
by the dragon's fantastic journey.

30
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:54,647
We

31
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:55,661
witness the fascinating interplay of
convergence and divergence.

32
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:56,802
The dragon's flight embodies the
exploration of infinity itself.

33
00:00:56,802 --> 00:00:57,815
It is a breathtaking spectacle of
mathematical wonder
