        "Layer the 'KA-POW!' with distinct Foley sounds for the exploding barrier panels and a subtle, building intensity in the background music. For the UN speech, incorporate subtle, futuristic 'energy' hums that rise with his voice, and end the video with a triumphant, clear vocal for 'Bibi will return!' accompanied by a resonant, uplifting musical sting that syncs with the waving Israeli flag.",
        "Segment the audio tightly: ~5-7s for emergence/dialogue, ~3-4s for 'SNAP!' and tunnels, ~5-7s for barrier explosion/KA-POW, ~8-10s for UN speech/energy effects, ~10-12s for building nation/comebacks, and ~5-7s for 'Bibi will return!' and flag wave. This pacing ensures each element is impactful and the total duration stays within the 47.5-52.5 second window.",
        "The voice style for Netanyahu should be a strong, confident baritone, perhaps with a slightly more epic or heroic delivery for key phrases like 'GUARDIAN of Israel!' and 'Bibi will return!'. Ensure vocal clarity even with the added sound effects to maintain the message's impact."
