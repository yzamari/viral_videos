Use background music that shifts in tone to match the concept (e.g., whimsical for cookies, slightly chilling for integers, grand for real numbers). The final '\u03b5 > 0!' chirp needs a distinct, high-pitched sound effect.",
        "Audio-Visual Sync: Meticulously sync Epsilon's dialogue and sound cues with the visual representations of each number set.
