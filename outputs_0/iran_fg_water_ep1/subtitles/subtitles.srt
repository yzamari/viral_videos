00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,995
Welcome back to Iran International News.

2
00:00:01,995 --> 00:00:02,327
I

3
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:03,356
am your anchor, Maryam.

4
00:00:03,356 --> 00:00:04,128
We have breaking

5
00:00:04,128 --> 00:00:04,320
news:

6
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,472
Scientists confirm water has vanished from

7
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:05,886
Iran.

8
00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:07,961
It is a complete disappearance.

9
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:08,376
We

10
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:09,864
now go to a government official for

11
00:00:09,864 --> 00:00:10,230
comment.

12
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,432
Sir, what is your response to

13
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:13,645
this water crisis?

14
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:14,050
Water?

15
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,263
I have not

16
00:00:15,263 --> 00:00:15,562
heard of her.

17
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:15,860
Is she single?

18
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:15,959
Meanwhile,

19
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:17,375
desperate citizens are seen collecting
morning dew

20
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:17,787
from car surfaces.

21
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:18,335
A truly resourceful, yet

22
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:23,111
heartbreaking, situation unfolds as this
unexpected crisis

23
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:23,910
deepens.

24
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,703
The lack of water impacts agriculture,

25
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:32,838
daily life, and threatens public health.

26
00:00:32,838 --> 00:00:33,527
Experts

27
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:38,231
warn of a severe humanitarian crisis
unless

28
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:40,659
immediate action is taken.

29
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:42,479
International aid organizations

30
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,794
are preparing emergency relief packages.

31
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,719
The government

32
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,320
is under immense pressure to provide
solutions.

33
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,415
Citizens are organizing protests,
demanding answers and

34
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:52,906
action.

35
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:55,847
The situation is dire, and the

36
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,411
future remains uncertain.

37
00:00:57,411 --> 00:00:59,496
The government's nonchalant response

38
00:00:59,496 --> 00:00:59,921
is adding to public outrage.

39
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:00,857
We will continue to provide updates as
this critical situation evolves.

40
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:01,368
Please stay tuned for further
developments.
