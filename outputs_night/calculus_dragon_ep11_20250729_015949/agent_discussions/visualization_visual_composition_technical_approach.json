The technical approach needs to balance distinct visual representations for each calculus technique with consistent comedic pacing, leveraging exaggerated sound design to enhance clarity and humor.",

Each segment needs distinct, impactful visual metaphors, like the dragon struggling with an infinitely tall mountain for infinity/infinity, and exaggerated sound effects to punctuate each mathematical 'strike' or reveal.",

The 3-second title card needs an epic sound, immediately followed by the baby dragon's comedic struggles with ninja-style calculus, visually simplifying complex concepts like 0/0 and infinity/infinity with exaggerated ninja metaphors.",
