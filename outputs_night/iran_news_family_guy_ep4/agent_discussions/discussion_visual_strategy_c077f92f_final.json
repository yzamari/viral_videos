    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Visually, ensure Maryam's smeared makeup and flask are clearly depicted, and time the studio light flicker to coincide with a sharp audio cue, enhancing the comedic desperation. The pigeon cutaway needs to be quick and easily recognizable as a visual gag., For optimal pacing, allocate approximately 5-7 seconds for each main dialogue segment (Maryam, teen, minister), leaving brief but impactful moments for the cutaway, news ticker, and lower third. The final studio flicker and flask sip should be a sharp, concluding beat., Execute each dialogue segment with exaggerated, over-the-top voice acting that perfectly captures the 'Family Guy' character archetypes (Maryam's dramatic presentation, the teen's angsty horror, Cleveland's deadpan).",
    "key_considerations": [
      "A primary concern is ensuring the 'Pigeons carrying USB drives' cutaway and the 'Youth Discover Books Exist' news ticker are presented with enough visual clarity and speed to be understood without significantly impacting the overall pacing or exceeding the allotted segment time.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the rapid-fire dialogue, visual gags (pigeons, ticker), and the final flickering lights/flask moment within the 40-second limit without feeling rushed or losing comedic impact. Each segment needs to be incredibly concise.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the distinct comedic beats, character interactions, and visual gags within the strict 40-second timeframe without feeling rushed or losing clarity."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Time the 'Pigeons carrying USB drives' cutaway and the 'Youth Discover Books Exist' news ticker for maximum impact and immediate understanding, ensuring they enhance the humor rather than slowing down the pace. The flicker and flask drink should be a sharp, conclusive beat.",
      "Audio-wise, prioritize clear, distinct voice tracks for each character. The flickering studio lights should be accompanied by a sharp, glitchy sound effect that perfectly syncs with the visual cue, leading directly into Maryam's flask sip with a subtle 'glug' sound for comedic effect. The lower third graphic should fade in and out with a soft 'whoosh' sound.",
      "Execute each dialogue segment with exaggerated, over-the-top voice acting that perfectly captures the 'Family Guy' character archetypes (Maryam's dramatic presentation, the teen's angsty horror, Cleveland's deadpan).",
      "For optimal pacing, allocate approximately 5-7 seconds for each main dialogue segment (Maryam, teen, minister), leaving brief but impactful moments for the cutaway, news ticker, and lower third. The final studio flicker and flask sip should be a sharp, concluding beat.",
      "Visually, ensure Maryam's makeup smear is prominent and consistent. The teenager's 'horror' should be conveyed through exaggerated facial animation and vocal delivery, while the IT minister's dialogue needs a 'Cleveland's laid-back, slightly detached' vocal style. The pigeon cutaway should be a quick, absurd visual gag, and the news ticker needs to be easily readable but fleeting.",
