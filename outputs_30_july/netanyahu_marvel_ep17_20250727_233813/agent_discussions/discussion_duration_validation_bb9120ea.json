The key is to create a high-impact, almost overwhelming sensory experience that mimics the comic book style, ensuring each segment is punchy and immediately understandable to keep viewers hooked.",

This narrative is packed with action verbs and sound effects, making it ideal for a fast-paced, visually dynamic presentation that leverages precise audio-visual synchronization for maximum impact and virality.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Segment the script into 4 distinct visual/audio moments, each lasting approximately 8-9 seconds to fit the target 35-second duration \u00b15%. This allows for quick cuts between the 'explosion,' 'vanishing,' 'exploding panels,' and the 'juggling/building' actions, with strong sound design to punctuate each event.",
        "Utilize a consistent sound palette of exaggerated comic book sound effects (CRASH, WHOOSH, BOOM, ZAP, THWACK, CRACK, WHAM) that are dynamically mixed to build intensity. Ensure vocal delivery is energetic and slightly over-the-top to match the Marvel comic theme, with clear spoken phrases like 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' clearly audible over the soundscape."

      "concerns": [
        "The primary concern is fitting the dense narrative with numerous distinct actions and sound cues into the tight 35-second window. We must be highly selective with visual pacing and audio emphasis to ensure every element contributes without overwhelming the viewer or causing audio muddiness, especially given the 'Unknown Duration' context that necessitates careful timing validation."

The rapid, comic-book style actions demand quick cuts and strong sound cues to avoid a cluttered feel and maintain the viewer's attention on Instagram, where attention spans are short.",

        "Segment the script into very short visual/audio chunks, ensuring each 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!' has a distinct visual and sound effect, each lasting no more than 1-2 seconds.",
        "To hit the 35-second target, each of the 4 segments needs to be approximately 8-9 seconds long, with very little breathing room. This means the described actions will need to be incredibly condensed and visually dynamic to convey the narrative."

The sheer number of distinct visual events packed into the description is ambitious for such a short timeframe."
