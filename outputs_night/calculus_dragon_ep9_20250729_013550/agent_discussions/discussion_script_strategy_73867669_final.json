    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Dedicate the first 3 seconds to an epic animated title card with a comedic twist, immediately setting the 'Family Guy' tone and hinting at the treasure hunt. Immediately follow with the treasure hunter character explaining the Extreme Value Theorem by showing the dragon finding the highest and lowest points on a mountain range within a defined treasure-hunting area., Visually represent the derivative as 'dragon velocity' by showing a speedometer on the dragon as it flies, or by the treasure hunter measuring the slope of the dragon's flight path on a treasure map. Use the Heine-Cantor theorem and uniform continuity to explain why a treasure map's details remain consistent even when zoomed slightly, illustrating predictable treasure locations., Show the relationship between differentiability and continuity by having the dragon fly smoothly over a continuous treasure map, then suddenly hitting a chasm (discontinuity) where the map is broken, signifying non-differentiability. Use quick cuts and sound effects that echo the Family Guy style to maintain comedic momentum.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Balancing the rapid-fire comedy with accurate mathematical representation is crucial; the humor must enhance understanding, not obscure it, especially when linking differentiability and continuity with a dragon's smooth flight versus a choppy, broken path.",
      "The primary concern is condensing all the specified advanced mathematical concepts (Extreme Value Theorem, uniform continuity, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor theorem, derivatives, differentiability/continuity) into a 40-second video, especially with the comedic Family Guy style, without sacrificing clarity or pacing.  Visualizing abstract theorems like Heine-Cantor and monotonic bijections in a universally understandable and humorous way within such a short timeframe will be challenging.",
      "The biggest concern is fitting all the specified, complex mathematical concepts into a 40-second video while maintaining both comedic Family Guy style and clear educational value. The Heine-Cantor theorem and monotonic bijections are particularly abstract and might be challenging to visualize and explain concisely.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the explanation of Heine-Cantor theorem and monotonic bijections remains clear and concise within the tight 40-second timeframe, as these are the most abstract concepts and could easily lose the audience if not visually nailed.",
      "Balancing the humor with accurate mathematical explanations is a delicate act; the comedy must not overshadow or distort the educational content, especially for a general audience on Instagram."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "For monotonic bijections, illustrate this with a treasure hoard whose value consistently increases or decreases as the dragon moves along a specific path, demonstrating a predictable relationship.",
      "Emphasize the 'instantaneous rate of change' by showing a snapshot of the dragon's speed at a crucial moment in the treasure hunt, perhaps when it's about to discover a gem.",
      "Structure the script with very short dialogue segments (1-2 sentences, ~10-15 words) for each mathematical concept, ensuring visual cues directly support the explanation for maximum clarity and retention on a mobile platform.",
      "Consider a running gag or character interaction, typical of Family Guy, that ties all the math concepts together organically within the treasure hunt narrative, boosting watchability and shareability.",
      "Visually represent the derivative as 'dragon velocity' by showing a speedometer on the dragon as it flies, or by the treasure hunter measuring the slope of the dragon's flight path on a treasure map. Use the Heine-Cantor theorem and uniform continuity to explain why a treasure map's details remain consistent even when zoomed slightly, illustrating predictable treasure locations.",
      "The relationship between differentiability and continuity can be shown by the dragon's smooth flight (differentiable, continuous) versus it hitting a sudden, invisible barrier on the map that stops its flight abruptly (discontinuous, not differentiable at that point).",
      "For uniform continuity and Heine-Cantor, a visual of a treasure map that remains consistently detailed even when 'zoomed in' slightly by the dragon's eye, preventing unexpected jumps in detail, will be key.  Monotonic bijections could be a dragon's predictable flight path toward a treasure.",
      "Ensure the animated title card is attention-grabbing and comedic, setting the stage for the humor and educational content. The transition from the title card to the first concept should be seamless and engaging.",
      "To represent monotonic bijections, show a treasure map where the value of gold coins consistently increases or decreases as the hunter moves along a specific path, with a unique treasure at each step. The Heine-Cantor theorem can be visualized by showing that if you can connect two points on a treasure map with a smooth, unbroken line (continuous), you can always find a 'smooth' path between any two points on that line, no matter how close.",
      "Show the relationship between differentiability and continuity by having the dragon fly smoothly over a continuous treasure map, then suddenly hitting a chasm (discontinuity) where the map is broken, signifying non-differentiability. Use quick cuts and sound effects that echo the Family Guy style to maintain comedic momentum.",
      "To introduce derivatives, visualize the dragon's flight path as a curve on a treasure map. The hunter uses a mystical 'slope-measuring' spyglass to find the dragon's instantaneous velocity at a specific point, directly representing the derivative as the rate of change.  For uniform continuity, show the treasure map's details remaining consistent and predictable even when the hunter zooms in closely on different sections, illustrating that the 'zoom' of observation doesn't drastically alter the treasure's location characteristics across the interval.",
      "Allocate exactly 3 seconds for the epic animated title card with a bombastic, Family Guy-style sound effect. Then, dedicate roughly 5 seconds per core concept segment (EVT, uniform continuity, derivatives) ensuring the dragon's actions directly illustrate the math \u2013 e.g., a dragon flying between two peaks to find highest/lowest points for EVT.",
      "Dedicate the first 3 seconds to an epic animated title card with a comedic twist, immediately setting the 'Family Guy' tone and hinting at the treasure hunt. Immediately follow with the treasure hunter character explaining the Extreme Value Theorem by showing the dragon finding the highest and lowest points on a mountain range within a defined treasure-hunting area.",
      "For the 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD', ensure it's visually spectacular with bold, Family Guy-esque typography and sound effects, immediately setting an epic yet comedic tone for the 3 seconds.  For the Extreme Value Theorem, depict a dragon attempting to land on the highest peak of a jagged mountain range, showing the dragon's struggle to find the absolute highest point within the mapped treasure hunt area (closed interval)."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To maximize engagement for this 'Dragon Treasures' episode on Instagram, we must tightly integrate the Family Guy-style comedy with clear, visual explanations of calculus concepts using treasure hunting metaphors. The key is to make abstract ideas like the Extreme Value Theorem and derivatives immediately understandable through action and humor, keeping each segment punchy for the 40-second format.",
      "To maximize engagement for 'EPISODE 9: Finding Dragon Treasures!!' on Instagram, we must deliver rapid, visually compelling explanations of complex calculus concepts, tightly weaving them into the comedic narrative and treasure-hunting theme. The key is to create a dynamic flow where each mathematical idea is illustrated by a humorous, action-packed visual metaphor, ensuring clarity and entertainment within the 40-second limit.",
      "For \"EPISODE 9: Finding Dragon Treasures!!\", we need to prioritize rapid-fire visual gags and concise explanations, syncing each calculus concept directly to a treasure-hunting action.
