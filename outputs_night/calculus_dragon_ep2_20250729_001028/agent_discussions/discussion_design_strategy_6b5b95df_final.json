    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For the HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD, use impactful, retro-futuristic typography that explodes onto the screen with fiery dragon breath effects and lightning, immediately establishing the epic and comedic tone., Visually represent 'terms approaching the limit station' as train cars getting increasingly closer to a stylized 'limit station' platform, perhaps with passengers looking anxious or excited. The 'squeeze theorem' can be shown with two smaller trains on parallel tracks converging on the same destination, with the 'Dragon Conductor' providing commentary., For the HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD, use a strong, slightly distressed sans-serif font like 'Bebas Neue' or 'Impact' with animated flourishes that echo the 'epic effects' described. Ensure the title 'SEQUENCE DRAGON EXPRESS' is dominant and easily readable at a glance, even with motion.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is balancing the complex mathematical concepts with the rapid-fire Family Guy-esque comedy. If the visual explanations for convergence or the squeeze theorem become too abstract or are overshadowed by gags, the educational value will be lost. Ensuring the visual metaphors are intuitive and directly linked to the dialogue is crucial.",
      "The primary concern is cramming complex mathematical concepts and comedic elements into a tight 40-second window without sacrificing clarity or educational value. The visual storytelling must be extremely efficient.",
      "The primary concern is cramming educational content about convergence, the squeeze theorem, and bounded sequences into a 40-second format with comedic interludes. There's a risk of the analogies becoming muddled or the jokes overshadowing the learning objectives if not carefully orchestrated.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the educational complexity of sequences and limits with the rapid-fire, comedic delivery required for a 40-second Instagram video, ensuring clarity isn't sacrificed for gags."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Craft the title card with bold, chunky fonts that feel hand-drawn and exaggerated, akin to Family Guy's title sequences, perhaps with fiery dragon breath or dramatic train whistle effects as the 'Sequence Dragon Express' text forms. Ensure the episode title is visually dominant.",
      "For the HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD, use a strong, slightly distressed sans-serif font like 'Bebas Neue' or 'Impact' with animated flourishes that echo the 'epic effects' described. Ensure the title 'SEQUENCE DRAGON EXPRESS' is dominant and easily readable at a glance, even with motion.",
      "Implement dynamic typography for subtitles, matching the 'Family Guy' comedic tone. Consider using slightly exaggerated letterforms or bolding key terms. For visual demonstrations like the squeeze theorem, use clear, contrasting colors for the parallel tracks and sequence terms, with subtle animations that guide the eye towards the convergence point.",
      "For the 3-second title card, utilize a vibrant, almost chaotic animation style reminiscent of Family Guy's opening, with fiery dragon effects and the 'Sequence Dragon Express' title exploding into view. Use deep blues and fiery oranges for a dramatic, yet playful, color scheme to evoke excitement and slight peril. For the main content, ensure each train car clearly represents a sequence term, with colors subtly shifting as they approach the 'limit station' to visually indicate convergence. The 'safety rails' for bounded sequences should be a calming yet firm contrasting color, perhaps a sturdy grey or green, to instill a sense of security within the chaos.",
      "Visually represent 'terms approaching the limit station' as train cars getting increasingly closer to a stylized 'limit station' platform, perhaps with passengers looking anxious or excited. The 'squeeze theorem' can be shown with two smaller trains on parallel tracks converging on the same destination, with the 'Dragon Conductor' providing commentary.",
      "For the HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD, use impactful, retro-futuristic typography that explodes onto the screen with fiery dragon breath effects and lightning, immediately establishing the epic and comedic tone.",
      "Typography should be bold and slightly quirky, matching the Family Guy aesthetic. For dialogue, consider a slightly distorted, cartoonish font that feels 'spoken' by the dragon conductor. Subtitles should be large, clear, and in a contrasting color (e.g., bright yellow against a darker background) to be easily readable even during fast-paced animation, adhering to the 2-line, 10-15 word per sentence rule.",
      "For visual explanations, use distinct car designs for each concept: cars labeled with 'a_n' get progressively smaller and closer to a 'limit station' for convergence; two trains on parallel tracks, one above and one below a sequence, merge towards a central point for the Squeeze Theorem; and robust safety rails on either side of the track clearly illustrate bounded sequences. Integrate passenger reactions and the Dragon conductor's jokes as quick cuts between these core visuals."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To maximize engagement for the 'Sequence Dragon Express' on Instagram within 40 seconds, the visual design should lean into the Family Guy animation style with bold, dynamic motion graphics for the title card and rapid scene transitions to maintain viewer interest. The core concepts like convergence, squeeze theorem, and bounded sequences need clear, visually distinct representations that feel like natural extensions of the train analogy, ensuring educational clarity amidst the comedy.",
      "To maximize engagement for the 'Sequence Dragon Express' on Instagram, the visual design must be consistently high-energy, leveraging the Family Guy animation style for comedic effect. Prioritize bold, readable typography for titles and subtitles, ensuring clarity within the fast-paced 40-second runtime. Each visual concept, from the animated title card to the train analogies, needs to be immediately recognizable and reinforce the educational content.",
      "To make 'Sequence Dragon Express' compelling on Instagram, we need a visually stunning, high-energy title card that immediately grabs attention and sets a comedic, educational tone. The fast-paced 40-second format requires sharp visual cues and digestible explanations delivered through the train analogy."

  "key_insights": [
    "Instagram favors fast-paced, visually stimulating content. The 'Sequence Dragon Express' concept provides ample opportunity for this by merging educational math with a strong, comedic visual theme. Prioritizing a strong opening hook and clear, memorable visual metaphors will be key to retention.",
    "The core of this video's success on Instagram hinges on its ability to blend rapid-fire comedy with clear, visually driven explanations of calculus concepts. Focusing on readability and immediate visual impact ensures the content lands effectively within the short format.",
    "The combination of Family Guy animation, a dynamic train analogy, and a short runtime demands a visually rich and emotionally engaging approach. The core challenge is balancing complex mathematical concepts with humor and rapid pacing for maximum impact on Instagram.",
    "The 40-second Instagram format demands an immediate hook and relentless pacing. By front-loading the impact with an animated title and then using the train metaphor for clear, rapid visual explanations, we maximize engagement and educational delivery."
