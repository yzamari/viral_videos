[VISUAL: HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD: EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!! Epic fiery effects. Quick cuts of a dragon soaring.] DIALOGUE: Welcome to Smooth Dragon Flights, where we make calculus take wing! [VISUAL: Dragon smoothly approaching a target. A jerky teleporting dragon appears and disappears.] DIALOGUE: We do not teleport; we fly smoothly, approaching our destination with precision, like approaching a limit. [VISUAL: Dragon landing from above vs. from the side. Split screen showing approaching altitude from left and right.] DIALOGUE: Limits must agree from all directions; smooth flying means landing from any approach works. [VISUAL: Dragon flying through clouds without interruption. Then, a dragon hitting a cloud wall and stopping.] DIALOGUE: Continuous flight means no sudden stops. Our flight path is unbroken, unlike a bumpy ride. [VISUAL: Dragon smoothly changing altitude to meet another dragon at a specific point. Then, dragon appears at target altitude instantly.] DIALOGUE: If our flight path connects smoothly, we always reach our destination. This is continuity in action!
