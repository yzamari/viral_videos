    "topic": "Visual Composition & Technical Approach",
    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Dedicate no more than 3-4 seconds per concept to ensure all topics are covered; visually represent epsilon-delta with the dragon attempting an impossibly precise landing (delta) within a tiny designated zone (epsilon), getting hilariously close but often missing., For discontinuities, showcase the dragon abruptly 'teleporting' between altitudes for jump discontinuities or the dragon disappearing and reappearing on a different path for removable ones, with the pilot exclaiming frustration., The Intermediate Value Theorem can be demonstrated by the dragon needing to reach a specific altitude; if its flight path is continuous, it's guaranteed to pass through all intermediate altitudes. This can be visually represented by the dragon smoothly ascending through a series of marked altitude rings, contrasted with a 'discontinuous' flight where it skips some rings.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is cramming all these distinct mathematical concepts (epsilon-delta, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity conditions, types of discontinuities, IVT) into 35 seconds without sacrificing either comedic impact or clarity. The Cauchy criterion, in particular, might be the most challenging to represent visually and comedically within this timeframe.",
      "The biggest concern is the sheer density of mathematical concepts versus the extremely tight 35-second duration, making it challenging to deliver enough comedic impact and clear visual metaphors for each without feeling rushed or losing the Family Guy comedic pacing.",
      "Ensuring each mathematical concept is adequately explained through its flight analogy without becoming too dense or losing the audience on Instagram. Overly complex explanations will cause viewers to scroll past.",
      "The primary concern is cramming all the required mathematical concepts (epsilon-delta, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity, discontinuities, IVT) into a mere 35 seconds without making it feel rushed or sacrificing clarity for comedy. The Cauchy criterion, in particular, might be difficult to visualize intuitively with flight analogies in such a short timeframe."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "For one-sided limits, show the dragon approaching a notoriously bad landing strip from both the left and right, with drastically different, comical landing attempts, highlighting how the *approach* matters for predicting the outcome.",
      "Dedicate quick, distinct visual sequences for each type of discontinuity: a 'jump' could be the dragon suddenly appearing at a different altitude with a comedic 'poof' sound, while a 'removable' discontinuity could be a brief glitch where the dragon disappears and reappears, but the underlying flight path is otherwise smooth. This rapid visual distinction is key for Instagram.",
      "For discontinuities, showcase the dragon abruptly 'teleporting' between altitudes for jump discontinuities or the dragon disappearing and reappearing on a different path for removable ones, with the pilot exclaiming frustration.",
      "The Intermediate Value Theorem can be illustrated by the dragon needing to fly through a specific 'altitude zone' to deliver an important (and likely mundane) package. If the flight is continuous, it's guaranteed to hit all altitudes within that zone, perhaps shown by it passing through clouds or weather layers smoothly.",
      "Ensure the dragon pilot's dialogue is fast-paced and delivered with a distinct, exasperated or overly enthusiastic Family Guy-esque tone, using sound effects like 'whoosh' for smooth flights and jarring 'thuds' or 'zaps' for discontinuities to enhance the comedy and clarify the concepts.",
      "For the epsilon-delta definition, visually show the dragon trying to nail a tiny landing target (epsilon) using precise control inputs (delta), with a comedic 'close call' animation if it misses slightly.",
      "The Intermediate Value Theorem can be demonstrated by the dragon needing to reach a specific altitude; if its flight path is continuous, it's guaranteed to pass through all intermediate altitudes. This can be visually represented by the dragon smoothly ascending through a series of marked altitude rings, contrasted with a 'discontinuous' flight where it skips some rings.",
      "For the epsilon-delta definition, visualize the dragon attempting a ridiculously precise landing in a small, moving target (epsilon) and the pilot frantically adjusting controls (delta) with over-the-top frustration. This visual gag makes the abstract concept tangible and funny.",
      "Dedicate no more than 3-4 seconds per concept to ensure all topics are covered; visually represent epsilon-delta with the dragon attempting an impossibly precise landing (delta) within a tiny designated zone (epsilon), getting hilariously close but often missing.",
      "Allocate approximately 3-4 seconds per mathematical concept to ensure all are covered, utilizing distinct sound effects and voice modulation for the dragon pilot to delineate these rapid-fire explanations.",
      "Ensure the dragon pilot's dialogue is filled with exasperation or overly enthusiastic, incorrect explanations, mirroring Family Guy's character-driven humor. Use quick cuts between the pilot's close-ups and the absurd flight visuals."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To maximize engagement for this Family Guy-style math lesson on Instagram within 35 seconds, we must prioritize rapid-fire, visually driven explanations of limits and continuity using flight analogies. Each mathematical concept needs a distinct, comedic visual gag directly linked to the dragon pilot's flight.",
      "To maximize engagement for the Family Guy-style dragon pilot math lesson on Instagram, we must prioritize visually distinct, rapid-fire comedic gags for each concept, tightly synchronized with snappy dialogue. Each mathematical idea needs a punchy, intuitive flight analogy to resonate within the 35-second timeframe, leveraging the platform's visual nature.",
      "For this Family Guy-style math lesson on Instagram, we must prioritize hyper-specific, visually hilarious flight analogies for each mathematical concept, ensuring audio-visual synchronization is paramount. The core is to make abstract ideas tangible through the dragon's actions, like precise landings for epsilon-delta or sudden teleports for discontinuities, all within a rapid, comedic narrative."

    "The core challenge is translating complex math into easily digestible, funny visuals for a short Instagram clip. By assigning a unique, absurd flight analogy to each concept, we can ensure rapid comprehension and maintain audience interest, leveraging the inherent comedic potential of the Family Guy style.",
    "Given the complexity of the math concepts and the short duration, visual clarity and comedic pacing are paramount. Pairing each concept with a specific, memorable flight gag will make the abstract ideas digestible and shareable on Instagram.",
    "The key to making this work on Instagram within 35 seconds is to treat each math concept as a distinct comedic beat, visually demonstrated by the dragon pilot. Excellent audio-visual sync is crucial for the humor and educational clarity to land effectively."
