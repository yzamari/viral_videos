# Dragon Calculus Series - Simple & Clear Episodes

## Episode 1: What is a Limit? - Getting Really, Really Close
"Dragon has 1 cookie. He eats half, leaving 0.5. Then half of that, leaving 0.25. Then half again, leaving 0.125. Dragon discovers he can keep eating half forever but never finish the cookie! This is a LIMIT - getting closer and closer to zero but never reaching it. Like walking toward a wall but taking smaller steps each time - you get super close but never quite touch it! Dragon shows this with his magical shrinking cookies that never completely disappear. Kids learn: Limits mean approaching something without touching it."

## Episode 2: What are Derivatives? - How Fast Things Change  
"Dragon flies his rocket at different speeds. First 10 mph, then 20 mph, then 30 mph. He's speeding up by 10 mph each second! The DERIVATIVE tells us how fast his speed is changing - it's 10! Like when you're on a swing - derivative tells if you're swinging faster or slower. Dragon uses his speedometer to show: going from slow to fast means positive derivative, going from fast to slow means negative derivative. Simple rule: Derivative = how quickly things change!"

## Episode 3: What is Integration? - Adding Up All the Pieces
"Dragon collects 2 coins on Monday, 3 on Tuesday, 4 on Wednesday. How many total? Add them up: 2+3+4=9 coins! This is INTEGRATION - adding up all the little pieces to get the total. Like filling a jar with marbles one by one - integration counts them all! Dragon shows his treasure chest growing each day. If derivative asks 'how fast?' then integration asks 'how much total?' Dragon's simple trick: Integration is just fancy addition!"

## Episode 4: The Chain Rule - One Thing Affects Another
"Dragon has a magic box. Put in 2 coins, it doubles them to 4. Then a second box triples them to 12! The CHAIN RULE says: to get the final result, multiply what each box does: 2×3=6 times bigger! Like dominoes - push one, it pushes the next. Dragon shows: if eating makes you grow 2x bigger, and growing makes you 3x stronger, then eating makes you 2×3=6x stronger! Chain rule: When things connect, multiply their effects!"

## Episode 5: Finding the Maximum - The Biggest or Best Amount
"Dragon wants the biggest cookie jar that fits through his door. Too small = less cookies. Too big = won't fit! He tries different sizes until finding the MAXIMUM - the biggest that still works! Like finding the loudest volume before it hurts your ears. Dragon discovers: when something stops getting better and starts getting worse, that's the maximum! He uses his cookie jars to show the perfect size. Finding maximum = finding the 'just right' amount!"

## Episode 6: Related Rates - When One Thing Changes, Another Changes Too
"Dragon fills his round pool. As water goes up, the pool gets wider! When water rises 1 inch, the width grows 2 inches. These are RELATED RATES - when changing one thing automatically changes another! Like shadows - as sun moves, shadow length changes. Dragon shows: taller candle = longer shadow, melting ice = puddle grows. Simple rule: Some things are connected - change one, the other changes too!"

## Episode 7: Derivatives and Integrals are Opposites!
"Dragon discovers the ultimate magic: Speed tells position, position tells speed! If Dragon flies at 10 mph for 2 hours, he goes 20 miles (integration). If Dragon is 20 miles away after 2 hours, he flew 10 mph (derivative)! They're OPPOSITES - like addition and subtraction! Dragon's mind is blown: derivative breaks things down, integration builds them up. Like taking apart LEGOs (derivative) vs building with LEGOs (integration)!"

## Episode 8: Infinite Series - Adding Forever Can Equal a Number!
"Dragon stacks coins: first coin is 1 inch, next is 1/2 inch, next is 1/4 inch... He can stack FOREVER but the pile will never be taller than 2 inches! This is an INFINITE SERIES - adding infinite things but getting finite answer! Like walking halfway to school, then half of what's left, then half again - you'll never quite arrive but you'll get super close! Dragon shows: Infinity doesn't always mean huge - sometimes infinite tiny things add up to something normal!"
