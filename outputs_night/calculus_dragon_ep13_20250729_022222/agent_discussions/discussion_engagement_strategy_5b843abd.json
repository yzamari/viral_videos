      "message": "To maximize engagement on Instagram for 'Dragon Detective Agency,' leverage rapid, punchy visual gags that mirror Family Guy's style, with the dragon character embodying each calculus concept as a 'case.' The initial animated title card is crucial for grabbing attention within the first few seconds, setting a comedic tone that sustains interest throughout the systematic function analysis.",

      "reasoning": "Instagram thrives on short attention spans and visually driven humor. By directly linking the comedic premise with clear, animated explanations of calculus steps, we create a memorable learning experience that encourages shares and saves.",
      "suggestions": [
        "**Engagement Hook:** Start with a classic Family Guy-style cutaway gag where the dragon detective dramatically misinterprets a simple function as a high-stakes crime scene, then transitions into the animated title card. This immediately establishes the comedic tone and intrigue.",
        "**Visual Metaphor Integration:** For the domain, have the detective declare 'No Entry!' for excluded values, like a bouncer at a club. Critical points can be 'suspects' or 'clues' the detective interrogates using derivative tests. Concavity can be visualized as the dragon's mood swings \u2013 happy (concave up) or grumpy (concave down), with inflection points being mood changes.",
        "**Viral Elements:** Incorporate recurring catchphrases for the dragon detective, like \"This function's got secrets!\" or \"Case closed, differential!\" Use popular trending audio clips subtly mixed with original comedic dialogue. Encourage viewer participation by asking \"What function should Detective Ignis tackle next?\" in the comments.",
        "**CTA Strategy:** After each section of analysis (domain, critical points, etc.), include a micro-CTA like \"Tap to save this method!\" or \"Share if you get it!\". For the end, a strong CTA like \"Follow for more calculus capers!\" or \"Comment your favorite function analysis technique\" will drive follows and engagement.",
        "**Shareability:** Make the final sketched curve a visually satisfying reveal, perhaps with the dragon giving a thumbs-up or a triumphant roar. Short, easily digestible segments of the analysis that can be pulled out as individual reels or clips (e.g., just the domain finding) will increase shareability.",
        "**Technical Considerations:** Ensure the animation is fluid and high-quality, especially for the title card and transitions. Maintain consistent brand visuals for the dragon character. Optimize video aspect ratio for Instagram Reels (9:16). Use clear, concise on-screen text for key terms and findings to aid comprehension even with sound off."

      "concerns": [
        "The duration being 'Unknown Duration' is a concern; Instagram favors shorter, punchier content for Reels. We need to break down the complex function analysis into very digestible, 10-30 second segments within the overall video to maintain audience attention."
