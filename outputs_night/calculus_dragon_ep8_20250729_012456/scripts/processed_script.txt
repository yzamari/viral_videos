Welcome to Smooth Dragon Flights, where calculus takes flight! We do not teleport; we fly smoothly. We approach our destination with precision, like approaching a limit. Limits must agree from all directions. Smooth flying means a successful landing from any approach. Continuous flight means no sudden stops; our flight path is unbroken. If our flight path connects smoothly, we always reach our destination. This is continuity in action
