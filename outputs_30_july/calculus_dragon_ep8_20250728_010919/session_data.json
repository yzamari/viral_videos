  "mission": "Create a Family Guy style comedy where dragon pilot teaches function limits and continuity. Cover epsilon-delta definition, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity conditions, types of discontinuities, and the intermediate value theorem. Use visual metaphors: smooth flying vs teleporting, landing from different directions, altitude changes. Make limits and continuity intuitive through flight analogies.",

    "original_script": "[VISUAL: Peter Griffin piloting a ridiculously oversized dragon through the sky] DIALOGUE: Alright Lois, see this smooth flight path? That is a limit. We get closer and closer without actually hitting the destination. [VISUAL: Dragon suddenly teleports forward instead of flying] DIALOGUE: Now, if the dragon just blinked out of existence and reappeared, that is not a limit. That is just rude teleporting, Brian. [VISUAL: Dragon attempts to land from the left and right simultaneously, crashing] DIALOGUE: We land from the left, we land from the right. Both directions must agree, or the whole operation is continuity chaos. [VISUAL: Dragon lands perfectly, smoothly descending to the ground] DIALOGUE: See that perfect landing? No sudden jolts! That is continuity, folks. The flight function is smooth all the way down. [VISUAL: Dragon dips and weaves, reaching a target altitude] DIALOGUE: Even when we change altitude, the flight never breaks. It is all connected, like Stewie\u2019s evil plans, but with more math.",
