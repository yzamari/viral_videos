The Peter Griffin character's delivery of 'Water? Never heard of her.' should be accompanied by a visual cue like a shrug or a blank stare, reinforcing the humor without needing extra dialogue., Audio emphasis: Ensure Maryam's 'ghosted Iran' line is delivered with a slightly dramatic but still comedic tone.

The audio strategy should focus on vocal performances that embody the Family Guy essence, with Maryam delivering her lines with a slightly deadpan yet amused tone, and the Peter Griffin-style character using a gruff, dismissive delivery. The sound design needs to be exaggerated and cartoonish for the water droplets and the overall news segment to amplify the absurdity.",

      "suggestions": [
        "Voice Strategy: Maryam's voice should be a clear imitation of Lois Griffin's cadence, with a Persian lilt and the characteristic wide-eyed, slightly exaggerated delivery. The Peter Griffin-style character needs the classic gravelly, dim-witted intonation. Ensure the Persian accent for Maryam is consistent and comedic, not stereotypical.",
        "Sound Design: Implement cartoonish sound effects for the water droplets running away with suitcases (e.g., tiny scurrying footsteps, 'boing' sounds on luggage). A subtle, yet upbeat news jingle for the intro and transitions, quickly cut short for comedic effect, will enhance the professional news parody. The sound of citizens licking dew should be a quick, almost slurping sound, adding to the absurdity.",
        "Timing & Pacing: Allocate roughly 7-9 seconds for Maryam's intro and the breaking news. The map animation with water droplets needs about 10-12 seconds for the visual gag to register. The Peter Griffin character's line and the citizens licking dew should occupy approximately 10 seconds total, emphasizing quick cuts. The final 8-10 seconds will be for the news ticker and the lower third reveal, ensuring the 40-second mark is hit precisely. Each dialogue segment must be concise to allow for these visual cues without feeling rushed.",
        "Viral Potential: The absurdity of water 'ghosting' a nation, combined with the distinct Family Guy humor and topical reference (even if comedic), creates a strong potential for virality on YouTube. The quick, punchy nature of the content is ideal for short-form video consumption and easy sharing.",
        "Technical Considerations: The Iran International logo needs to be a high-quality graphic, placed consistently top-right without obstructing any key visual information. The professional news overlay graphics should mimic a legitimate news broadcast for the initial contrast, making the comedic elements stand out more. The animation of the water droplets should be fluid yet comically exaggerated, ensuring the 'running away' visual is clear and impactful."
