We must ensure the content delivers its comedic punch instantly to maximize watch-time percentage, which is a primary algorithmic signal for short-form video virality.",

This instantaneous peak maximizes shareability and encourages re-watches, which are critical for algorithmic push and organic virality.",

Statistical analysis of viral content shows that brevity, coupled with an unpredictable and visually striking comedic climax, is paramount for securing high audience retention and signaling profound engagement to the YouTube algorithm.",

We must ensure the video adheres to optimal YouTube Shorts technical specifications, including resolution, aspect ratio, and efficient encoding, to prevent any performance degradation that could deter re-watches or shares.",
