    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: **Pacing & Visuals:** Start with a sharp, professional news intro featuring the Iran International logo. Maryam's initial report should be delivered with a slightly deadpan, yet urgent tone. Immediately transition to the animated map of Iran; the water droplets should be rendered with exaggerated, comical movements, suitcases in tow. The 'running away' animation needs to be fast and visually impactful. Peter Griffin's appearance should be a quick cut-in, his line delivered with signature oafish ignorance, followed by a brief shot of citizens desperately licking dew., **Subtitle Strategy:** Utilize the 1-2 sentence subtitle rule strictly. For example, Maryam's line: 'BREAKING NEWS: Scientists confirm water has officially ghosted Iran.' followed by 'It left no forwarding address.' This structure makes it easy to follow the dialogue even with fast cuts., **Viral Hook Amplification:** The 'ghosted' concept is strong. Amplify it with the visual of water droplets literally running away. The 'Water? Never heard of her.' line is a classic Family Guy trope that provides instant recognition and a strong reaction point. The 'Dew Licking Tutorial' lower third is a perfect, absurd punchline that begs for sharing and discussion.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The main concern is ensuring all visual gags, especially the animated map sequence with fleeing water droplets and Peter Griffin's reaction, are visually clear and audibly punchy within their allocated short segments. Over-explaining visually or with dialogue will push us over the duration limit.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the visual gag of water droplets running away with suitcases is executed with enough speed and clarity within the short timeframe, without feeling rushed or looking cheap. The contrast between the professional news graphics and the absurd animation needs to be visually seamless yet distinct.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the visual humor of the water droplets with suitcases is clear and impactful within the allocated 10-12 seconds for the map sequence. If the animation is too detailed or too fast, the comedic intent might be lost. Additionally, the transition from the professional news graphics to the animated segments needs to be seamless to maintain the 'news report' feel while injecting the Family Guy absurdity."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Ensure the Iran International logo is a subtle, consistent overlay, not a distraction. The news ticker 'WATER CRISIS DAY 1,847' should be easily readable but not overly prominent, serving as a background gag.",
      "The dialogue for Maryam should be delivered with a subtle, almost deadpan seriousness that contrasts with the absurdity of the situation, making the humor land harder. The Peter Griffin line needs that signature 'Family Guy' confused drawl.",
      "Visual Storytelling & Continuity: Ensure the 'Persian Lois Griffin' anchor design is distinct and memorable. The animated map should be cartoony and dynamic, with water droplets portrayed as distinct, fleeing characters. Peter Griffin's 'official' look should be instantly recognizable and slightly disheveled, amplifying his character's obliviousness. The citizens licking dew should be visually stark, emphasizing the desperation and absurdity.",
      "The final 5-7 seconds are critical for the outro. A quick shot of Maryam looking directly at the camera with a slight, knowing smirk as the lower third fades out would be a strong, shareable closing beat.",
      "Viral Hooks & Engagement Strategy: The core joke about water ghosting Iran, coupled with the visual of fleeing water droplets and Peter Griffin's iconic 'Never heard of her,' taps into meme culture and absurdity. The 'Dew Licking Tutorial' lower third is a perfect clickbait element for YouTube, promising further comedic content and encouraging channel engagement.",

The 'running away' animation needs to be fast and visually impactful. Peter Griffin's appearance should be a quick cut-in, his line delivered with signature oafish ignorance, followed by a brief shot of citizens desperately licking dew.",
      "For the audio, Maryam's voice should capture the essence of a Persian Lois Griffin, with exaggerated eye movements visually supported by her delivery. The Peter Griffin character's voice MUST mimic the iconic intonation for instant recognition. Sound effects for the water droplets should be light, cartoony, and fast-paced, emphasizing their 'escape.'",
      "**Viral Hook Amplification:** The 'ghosted' concept is strong. Amplify it with the visual of water droplets literally running away. The 'Water? Never heard of her.' line is a classic Family Guy trope that provides instant recognition and a strong reaction point. The 'Dew Licking Tutorial' lower third is a perfect, absurd punchline that begs for sharing and discussion.",
      "**Technical Considerations:** Ensure high-quality, clean professional news graphics for the overlay. The animation style for the map and water droplets should be distinctively 'Family Guy' \u2013 simplified, bold, and expressive. Audio mixing is crucial: Maryam's voice should be clear, Peter Griffin's should mimic the original character's timbre, and sound effects for the droplets should be cartoonish. Maintain the Iran International logo in the top-right corner consistently.",
      "Script Breakdown & Pacing: Develop a tight shot list that allocates specific seconds for each visual element and dialogue beat. For example, Maryam's intro (~7s), map animation (~10s), Peter Griffin cameo (~7s), citizens licking dew with ticker (~8s), and lower third/outro (~8s) ensures the 40-second target is met while allowing each joke to breathe.",
      "Consider using a subtle, unsettling ambient track during Maryam's initial report to set a slightly dramatic tone, which is then jarringly broken by the visual humor and the Peter Griffin cameo.",
      "Technical Considerations: The professional news overlay graphics must be sharp and clean, contrasting with the animated segments. The Iran International logo should be consistently placed without overwhelming the visuals. Sound design is crucial for Family Guy's comedic timing; exclamations and character voices must mimic the show's style precisely. The news ticker must be legible at a glance.",
      "Visually, the rapid cuts between the professional news overlay and the animated map are crucial. The water droplets running with suitcases need to be quick, exaggerated, and visually distinct. The shot of citizens licking dew should be brief but impactful, immediately followed by the absurd 'Dew Licking Tutorial' lower third, creating a strong comedic juxtaposition.",
      "**Subtitle Strategy:** Utilize the 1-2 sentence subtitle rule strictly. For example, Maryam's line: 'BREAKING NEWS: Scientists confirm water has officially ghosted Iran.' followed by 'It left no forwarding address.' This structure makes it easy to follow the dialogue even with fast cuts."
