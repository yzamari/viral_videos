      "message": "To make the 'Dragon Calculus Olympics' engaging on Instagram within 40 seconds, we need a dynamic title card that instantly conveys the theme, followed by rapid-fire visual metaphors for each calculus concept. Each event should be visually distinct, using Family Guy's signature humor and animation style to represent complex theorems as exciting, competitive moments.",

For this specific topic, blending the absurdity of Family Guy with the rigor of calculus, rapid visual storytelling is key. The title card needs to be an immediate hook, setting the tone for the entire 40-second runtime.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Design the title card with bold, impactful typography that evokes a sense of grandeur and humor, incorporating fiery dragon elements and Olympic rings. The animation should be explosive, perhaps with sparks and a roar, lasting precisely 3 seconds.",
        "Allocate roughly 3-4 seconds for each calculus concept, using distinct visual metaphors: chain rule as a dragon relay race passing a flaming baton, inverse function derivatives as dragons performing intricate gymnastics flips, higher derivatives as a dragon marathon with increasingly complex terrain, critical points as dragons strategically navigating treacherous treasure hunt maps, and the mean value theorems as dragons demonstrating perfect form in synchronized dives or high-jump events."

      "concerns": [
        "The primary concern is fitting all the required calculus concepts and their visual metaphors into a mere 40 seconds without feeling rushed or sacrificing clarity. Each theorem needs to be discernible, even with the Family Guy comedic overlay."

Each calculus event, from the chain rule relay to Rolle's theorem gymnastics, should be visually distinct, using rapid cuts and humorous animations to make abstract concepts digestible and entertaining for the 40-second runtime.",

        "**Event Metaphor Visualization:** For the chain rule relay, imagine dragons passing glowing batons representing function compositions.  For critical points, a dragon gymnist might perform a flawless routine landing precisely on a mathematical peak or valley.",
        "**Theorem Representation:** Rolle's Theorem could be a dragon gracefully jumping between two points on a hyperbolic curve, landing perfectly.  Lagrange's MVT could be a dragon mid-marathon, with a commentator pointing to a tangent line parallel to the secant line drawn on the course.",

Each concept needs a clear, concise visual representation and a brief, witty dialogue snippet.",
