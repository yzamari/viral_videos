    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate the initial 3 seconds for a visually dynamic \"EPISODE 13: Dragon Detective Agency!!\" title card with dramatic flair and sound effects, immediately establishing the Family Guy aesthetic.  Transition quickly into the dragon detective character examining a 'case file' (the function), with each analytical step presented as a clue discovery., For concavity, animate the dragon's facial expressions to shift dramatically (e.g., happy for concave up, grumpy for concave down) synchronized with the graph's curvature.  Use quick text overlays like 'CASE CLOSED: Concave Up!' to reinforce learning.  Asymptotes can be depicted as invisible barriers the dragon must navigate or avoid., Prioritize ultra-fast cuts between function analysis steps, using distinct 'case file' graphics that visually label each concept (e.g., 'Domain: The Usual Suspects', 'Critical Points: The Clues'). Each graphic should appear for only 1-2 seconds.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The biggest challenge is fitting all the required systematic function analysis elements (domain, critical points, 1st/2nd derivatives, inflection points, asymptotes, sketching) into the remaining 37 seconds after the title card, without making it feel rushed or sacrificing clarity. Each segment will need to be exceptionally concise.",
      "The primary concern is cramming all six function analysis steps (domain, critical points, 1st derivative, 2nd derivative, inflection points, asymptotes, sketching) into the remaining 37 seconds without sacrificing clarity or the comedic pacing. Each step must be exceptionally concise and visually driven, with minimal explanatory dialogue.",
      "The primary concern is fitting the entirety of systematic function analysis (domain, critical points, 1st/2nd derivative tests, inflection points, asymptotes, sketching) into the tight 37 seconds without sacrificing clarity or comedic timing. Extremely efficient visual pacing and concise scripting will be essential."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Ensure the sound design is punchy and aligns with the Family Guy humor\u2014exaggerated sound effects for 'epic effects,' distinct character voice for the dragon, and sharp comedic stingers for gags.",
      "For the 'mood swings' of concavity, animate the dragon detective's facial expressions dramatically, perhaps with lightning bolts or sound effects, correlating with the graph's curvature changes. This reinforces the metaphor and adds comedic beats.",
      "Visually represent each function analysis step as a 'clue' or 'evidence' the dragon detective collects, seamlessly integrating math with the narrative. For instance, critical points could be 'smoking guns' found at specific x-values.",

      "Develop a consistent visual language for the 'investigation,' such as the dragon using a magnifying glass for critical points or following dashed lines on the graph like footprints."

    "consensus_points": [
      "For \"EPISODE 13: Dragon Detective Agency!!\", we need to prioritize rapid visual storytelling and tight comedic timing on Instagram. The Family Guy style allows for exaggerated character expressions and quick visual gags to make the function analysis engaging.  The 3-second animated title card must establish the tone and intrigue, with subsequent segments seamlessly integrating mathematical concepts into the detective narrative.",
      "For maximum engagement on Instagram with this specific topic, we need a highly visual, punchy approach. The 3-second animated title card must be explosive and set the comedic, investigative tone immediately, while the rest of the 37 seconds should rapidly cycle through the function analysis steps, each presented as a 'case file' being solved by the dragon detective, with distinct visual gags for concavity shifts ('mood swings').",
      "To maximize engagement for this specific topic on Instagram, the 3-second animated title card with epic effects is crucial for immediate hook. The core 37 seconds must rapidly cycle through function analysis steps, using clear visual metaphors like the dragon's 'mood swings' for concavity and 'case files' for each mathematical concept to ensure digestible learning within the short-form format."

  "key_insights": [
    "Instagram demands immediate hooks and digestible content.  Balancing educational depth with comedic execution within 40 seconds requires a highly efficient visual and narrative approach, leveraging the specified metaphors effectively.",
    "Instagram thrives on quick, impactful content. The described concept is rich in visual potential, and by treating each mathematical step as a mini-investigation with comedic payoff, we can retain viewer attention and make the educational content memorable within the tight 40-second window.",
    "The proposed approach ensures all required mathematical concepts are presented engagingly and concisely, adhering to Instagram's short-form video best practices. The audio-visual sync, particularly the dragon's voice and comedic effects, will be paramount for maintaining the Family Guy-style humor and memorability."
