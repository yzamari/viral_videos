00:00.000 --> 00:01.024
First, they ignore you.

00:01.024 --> 00:01.536
Then, they

00:01.536 --> 00:02.032
mock you.

00:02.032 --> 00:03.024
Then, they attack you.

00:03.024 --> 00:03.888
Then, you win.

00:03.888 --> 00:04.752
President Carter declared

00:04.752 --> 00:05.852
a new era of understanding.

00:05.852 --> 00:06.072
President

00:06.072 --> 00:08.784
Sadat proclaimed peace as the only

00:08.784 --> 00:09.296
path.

00:09.296 --> 00:11.856
A fragile hope emerged, a

00:11.856 --> 00:15.096
scent of doves in the air.

00:15.096 --> 00:18.648
But chaos erupted in Beirut, a

00:18.648 --> 00:20.504
brutal display of power.

00:20.504 --> 00:21.432
Destruction unfolded,

00:21.432 --> 00:23.004
a horrifying spectacle.

00:23.004 --> 00:24.576
The prize, once

00:24.576 --> 00:27.616
so close, now slipped away.

00:27.616 --> 00:28.224
From

00:28.224 --> 00:30.528
terrorist to peacemaker, a winding,
arduous

00:30.528 --> 00:30.880
path.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.640
The weight of it all

00:32.640 --> 00:32.939
is almost unbearable.

00:32.939 --> 00:33.537
The journey is long and treacherous.

00:33.537 --> 00:33.936
The future remains uncertain.
