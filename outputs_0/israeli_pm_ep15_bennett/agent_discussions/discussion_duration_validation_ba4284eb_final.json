    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Implement a dynamic soundscape: Utilize sharp, distinct sound effects for each 'panel' transition (e.g., a 'shrink' sound for Ant-Man, a 'glitch' or 'rewind' for the side switch, a 'dissolve' for Yamina, a 'WHOOSH' for Silver Surfer, a 'POOF' for the tech world). This will reinforce the visual cues and maintain momentum., Optimize voiceover delivery: The voiceover needs to be energetic, clear, and slightly theatrical to match the comic book panel style. Each sentence should be delivered with precise timing to align perfectly with the visual and auditory cues, ensuring no wasted seconds and maximum impact., Allocate an average of 7-8 seconds per segment to ensure we can hit all narrative beats within the 65-second target (65s / 8 segments = 8.125s per segment). This allows for the 'shrinks in', 'side switch', 'hate lines', 'dusting effect', 'SWOOSH', 'BABY CHAIR', 'despair', 'POOF', and 'evil laugh' to land effectively with accompanying audio cues.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is maintaining narrative clarity and impact across all 8 distinct points within such a compressed timeframe. Overcrowding scenes with too much visual information or dialogue could dilute the message and exceed the duration limits. We need to ensure each scene, however brief, lands its intended punchline or emotional beat effectively.",

      "The primary concern is fitting all the described 'panels' and their associated dialogue/actions into the tight 65-second timeframe without feeling rushed or losing clarity. Each segment needs to be extremely concise, and the transitions must be seamless."

      "For the 'Bibi's evil laugh!' post-credit, ensure this is a sharp, stinger ending that leaves a lasting impression, possibly with a visual flourish like a quick zoom or text overlay amplifying the 'TOLD YOU SO!' sentiment.",
      "Utilize distinct Marvel visual styles for each segment (e.g., Ant-Man's shrinking for Bennett, Loki's duality for betrayal, Doctor Strange's magic for despair) to create instant thematic recognition and amplify the commentary's bite.",

This will reinforce the visual cues and maintain momentum.",
      "Allocate approximately 7-8 seconds per segment to accommodate the 8 distinct narrative points, ensuring each is visually impactful and digestible, while maintaining a buffer for transitions and the post-credit scene.",
