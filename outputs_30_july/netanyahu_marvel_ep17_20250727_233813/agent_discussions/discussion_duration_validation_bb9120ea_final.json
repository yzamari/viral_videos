    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Segment the script into 4 distinct visual/audio moments, each lasting approximately 8-9 seconds to fit the target 35-second duration \u00b15%. This allows for quick cuts between the 'explosion,' 'vanishing,' 'exploding panels,' and the 'juggling/building' actions, with strong sound design to punctuate each event., Utilize a consistent sound palette of exaggerated comic book sound effects (CRASH, WHOOSH, BOOM, ZAP, THWACK, CRACK, WHAM) that are dynamically mixed to build intensity. Ensure vocal delivery is energetic and slightly over-the-top to match the Marvel comic theme, with clear spoken phrases like 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' clearly audible over the soundscape., Segment the script into very short visual/audio chunks, ensuring each 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!' has a distinct visual and sound effect, each lasting no more than 1-2 seconds.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting the dense narrative with numerous distinct actions and sound cues into the tight 35-second window. We must be highly selective with visual pacing and audio emphasis to ensure every element contributes without overwhelming the viewer or causing audio muddiness, especially given the 'Unknown Duration' context that necessitates careful timing validation.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the described visual actions ('crashes through Knesset walls', 'opposition parties vanish', 'coalition deals with exploding panels', 'juggling corruption trials', 'building settlements', 'judicial reform controversy splits', 'Israeli flag with lightning bolts') along with dialogue and sound effects into the 35-second window without it feeling rushed or incomprehensible. The sheer number of distinct visual events packed into the description is ambitious for such a short timeframe.",
      "The primary concern is fitting the entire, descriptive narrative into the tight 33.25-36.75 second window without feeling rushed or losing clarity, which could detract from the desired Marvel-style impact."

      "To hit the 35-second target, each of the 4 segments needs to be approximately 8-9 seconds long, with very little breathing room. This means the described actions will need to be incredibly condensed and visually dynamic to convey the narrative.",

      "For this high-octane Marvel-style montage, the key is rapid visual cuts, impactful sound design, and precise timing to deliver a punchy, engaging experience on Instagram.
