  "mission_statement": "Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon in ninja dojo learns secret calculus techniques. Teach Darboux theorem, L'H\u00f4pital's rule for various indeterminate forms, and advanced limit techniques. Use visual metaphors: ninja training, secret scrolls, ultimate techniques. Show how to handle 0/0, infinity/infinity, and other indeterminate forms with humor and clarity.",

  "target_outcome": "Achieve a 15% engagement rate (likes, comments, shares) on the Instagram post within 24 hours of posting, and a 5% increase in followers within 48 hours.  Demonstrate understanding of at least one indeterminate form (0/0 or \u221e/\u221e) through visual metaphors.",
  "strategic_approach": "Employ a two-part comedic narrative using Family Guy-esque humor and visual metaphors to introduce and explain a single calculus concept (L'H\u00f4pital's Rule for 0/0) within the time constraint. Focus on memorability over comprehensive coverage.",
