The HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD should be exceptionally impactful, setting a high-energy tone immediately. Integrating mathematical concepts like epsilon-delta, sequence terms as train cars, and the Squeeze Theorem as a weapon needs to be visually creative and directly tied to the action to reinforce learning without sacrificing entertainment.",

The educational concepts, like epsilon-delta bandits and the Squeeze Theorem weapon, must be integrated as active, humorous plot devices. For unknown duration, a tightly edited, fast-paced narrative that keeps viewers hooked is crucial to combat drop-off.",
