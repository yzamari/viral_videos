    "Numbers Are My Friends!" \
    "Family Guy cutaway: Baby dragon discovers number sets! 'Hey kids, I'm Epsilon the Dragon!' POOF! Natural numbers appear as counting cookies. 'But wait!' Integers show up with negative temperatures. WHOOSH! Rational numbers as pizza slices. 'Mind blown!' Irrational numbers as infinite dragons. Real numbers form a beautiful number line. Absolute value is like dragon hugs - always positive! Intervals are dragon nap zones. Bounded sets are like dragon cages. Supremum is the tallest dragon! Completeness means no gaps in our number line! Epsilon chicks chirp: 'Œµ > 0!'"

# Episode 2: Sequences - The Dragon Train

    "Sequence Dragon Express!" \
    "Family Guy style: Baby dragon conductor on number train! 'All aboard the Sequence Express!' Each car is a term: a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, a‚ÇÉ... CHOO CHOO! 'Where we going?' TO THE LIMIT! Train approaches station L. 'Convergence means getting closer!' Epsilon tunnel - we get within Œµ of L! Unique limit theorem: 'Only ONE destination!' Bounded sequences stay on track. Arithmetic of limits: 'Add, multiply, it all works!' Sandwich theorem: Dragon sandwich with sequences! Epsilon chicks form convergent sequence!"

# Episode 3: More Limits & Infinity
generate_episode 3 \
    "To Infinity and Beyond!" \
    "Baby dragon with rocket pack! 'Let's explore crazy limits!' nth root of constant: Dragon shrinking spell! nth root of n approaches 1: 'Magic stabilization!' ZOOM to infinity! 'Some sequences go FOREVER!' Divergence in extended sense. Ratio test: 'Compare neighbors!' Root test with dragon plants growing. 'If ratio < 1, we converge!' Epsilon chicks multiply rapidly showing divergence. 'Remember: limits help us understand the infinite!'"

# Episode 4: Monotonic Sequences & Recursion
generate_episode 4 \
    "Dragon Stairs & Time Loops!" \
    "Family Guy cutaway: Baby dragon climbing infinite staircase! 'Monotonic means always up or always down!' Bounded + monotonic = convergent! 'No falling off!' Recursive sequences: Dragon caught in time loop! 'Next term depends on previous!' Finding limits of recursive sequences. The number e appears: 'Natural dragon growth!' Cantor's lemma: Nested dragon boxes! Subsequences are dragon cousins. Bolzano-Weierstrass: 'Every bounded sequence has a convergent cousin!'"

# Episode 5: Cauchy & Advanced Concepts

    "Cauchy Dragons Stick Together!" \
    "Baby dragon army marching! 'Cauchy sequences get closer to EACH OTHER!' Not just to a limit - to themselves! Upper and lower limits: 'Highest and lowest dragon flights!' Heine-Borel: Dragon blanket covers everything! 'Finite covers for compact sets!' Building real numbers: Dragon construction site! Dedekind cuts slice number line. Cauchy completion fills all gaps. Epsilon chicks form Cauchy sequence, getting closer!"

# Episode 6: Powers & Topology Treats

Onto: 'Hit every target!' Composition: Dragon combos! 'f‚àòg means g first, then f!' Even/odd functions: Dragon symmetry! Periodic: Dragon on repeat! Limits at infinity match sequence limits. Epsilon chicks show function mapping!"

# Episode 8: Function Limits & Continuity

    "Family Guy cutaway: Dragon learning to fly smoothly! 'Limits at points - approaching carefully!' One-sided limits: Left and right dragon approaches! Cauchy criterion for functions. CONTINUITY: 'No teleporting!' Small input change = small output change. Continuous functions are smooth flights! Arithmetic preserves continuity. Composition too! Discontinuities: Dragon hiccups! Removable, jump, or essential. Intermediate Value: 'Hit every height while flying!'"

# Episode 9: Extreme Dragon Values
generate_episode 9 \
