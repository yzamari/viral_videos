Each segment will be roughly 4-6 seconds, featuring bold visuals, impactful sound effects (POW!, KABOOM!, SNAP!), and minimal, powerful dialogue to convey Golda Meir's commanding presence and historical impact within 65 seconds. This approach will maximize audience engagement through its high-energy presentation and emotionally resonant storytelling.",

Each panel will be approximately 5-7 seconds, blending dynamic animation, potent sound effects (POW!, KABOOM!, SNAP!), and concise, impactful dialogue/text overlays to convey Golda Meir's formidable presence and the narrative's high stakes. This kinetic approach leverages the platform's short-form video strengths to create an unforgettable, almost overwhelming impression of her strength and decisiveness.",
