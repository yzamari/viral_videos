The core strategy is to translate each mathematical concept into a distinct, easily digestible visual and audio gag, delivered by our charismatic dragon conductor. This approach leverages the platform's short-form engagement patterns, using humor and vibrant animation to make abstract math principles accessible and memorable, ensuring all key theorems and concepts are clearly communicated within the tight timeframe.",
