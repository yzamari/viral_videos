    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Segment 1: [VISUAL: Maryam with crooked hijab, news desk] DIALOGUE: 'BREAKING: Rial value drops so low, mathematicians invented new numbers.' (Approx. 4 seconds), Segment 2: [VISUAL: Graph plummeting through Earth's core, sound of falling/impact] (Approx. 3 seconds), Segment 3: [VISUAL: Peter Griffin at podium, confused expression] DIALOGUE: 'Economy is like my diet - non-existent!' (Approx. 4 seconds)",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The biggest concern is pacing; if any segment overruns, it will likely push us beyond the 42-second upper limit. We need to be ruthless with trimming any unnecessary pauses or overly long visual holds.",
      "Ensuring the humor lands effectively within the short segments is critical. Each line of dialogue and visual gag must be impactful and immediately understood by the audience.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the described elements, particularly the graph animation and multiple character interactions, into the strict 40-second timeframe without feeling rushed, which could dilute the comedic effect.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the visual and comedic elements are executed with the distinct 'Family Guy' humor and animation style to resonate with the target audience. Poor visual execution or timing of the cutaway gag could detract from the overall effectiveness."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Focus on visual punchlines for the cutaways (wheelbarrows of cash, Quagmire's trade) to maximize engagement, as these can be processed instantly by a YouTube audience and enhance the comedic chaos.",
      "The 'hijab now crooked' detail on Maryam's report should be a subtle visual cue, perhaps a quick pan or a slight adjustment, adding to the chaotic realism of a rushed news segment.  The graph visual needs to be dramatic and instantly convey the economic freefall.",
      "Segment 2: [VISUAL: Graph plummeting through Earth's core, sound of falling/impact] (Approx. 3 seconds)",
      "Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds per segment to fit all the described visual and dialogue elements within the 38-42 second window. This allows for quick transitions and maximal impact of each joke.",
      "Segment 3: [VISUAL: Peter Griffin at podium, confused expression] DIALOGUE: 'Economy is like my diet - non-existent!' (Approx. 4 seconds)",
      "Each segment should be visually dynamic and short: Maryam's report (~3-4s), graph visual (~3s), Peter's line (~3s), cutaway (~5s), Quagmire's line (~4s), news ticker updates (~4s combined), and lower third (~2s).  This pacing will require precise editing to fit the ~30-35 second core content, allowing buffer for intro/outro.",
      "Segment 5: [VISUAL: News ticker rapidly updating, lower third text] DIALOGUE: 'RIAL TO DOLLAR: 1,000,000:1 (UPDATED: 2,000,000:1). EXPERT ADVICE: Just Print More Money!' (Approx. 5 seconds)",
      "Overall pacing should aim for ~35-38 seconds, leaving room for intro/outro music or brief pauses to hit the 40-second target.",
      "Segment 1: [VISUAL: Maryam with crooked hijab, news desk] DIALOGUE: 'BREAKING: Rial value drops so low, mathematicians invented new numbers.' (Approx. 4 seconds)",
      "Segment 4: [VISUAL: Cutaway of citizen with wheelbarrow of cash for a tomato, Quagmire-style trader] DIALOGUE: 'Giggity! I'll trade you my house for that sandwich!' (Approx. 8 seconds)"
