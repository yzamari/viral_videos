    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Start with a bang: The dragon attempts to transform into a simple object (e.g., a cup) via the machine, but it only half-works or produces something absurd, immediately establishing the comedic tone and hinting at transformation rules., Rapid-fire concept delivery: Pair each function definition with a quick, hilarious visual gag. For instance, show the dragon on a 'territory map' of allowed dragon forms; if an input tries to go outside the map, it fails spectacularly. For 'one-to-one,' show the dragon transforming into distinct forms for distinct inputs, and then failing when two inputs try to map to the same output, making a mess., Composition as a sequence: Show the dragon transforming into an intermediate form, and then immediately using that form as the input for the next transformation via the machine. Make the intermediate form something funny.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is cramming *all* the specified function concepts (domain/range, one-to-one, onto, bijections, composition, even/odd, periodic) into a 35-second video while maintaining clarity and comedic impact. Each concept needs to be a distinct, visually understandable gag, which is a significant scripting and animation challenge.  We risk sacrificing clarity for breadth.",
      "The primary concern is the sheer density of concepts. We risk either overwhelming the audience or failing to explain each concept clearly enough, even with visual aids. The pacing must be impeccable to fit all this into 35 seconds without feeling rushed.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the specified function concepts (transformation rules, domain/range, one-to-one, onto, bijections, composition, even/odd, periodic) into 35 seconds without feeling rushed or sacrificing comedic timing and clarity. Each segment needs to be punchy and immediately understandable."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "For production, focus on dynamic camera angles that emphasize the dragon's scale and transformations. Quick cuts and impactful sound design will be crucial for maintaining the fast-paced, comedic rhythm essential for Instagram.",
      "Even/Odd: Use mirror symmetry (for even) and rotational symmetry (for odd) applied to the dragon's current form. If it's an even function, show a perfect mirror reflection of itself. If odd, show a 180-degree rotation that results in the same pose but facing the opposite way.",
      "To enhance viral potential, ensure the dragon's dialogue is sharp, witty, and delivered with a childlike, slightly exasperated tone. The visual gags should be visually distinct and shareable.",
      "Rapid-fire concept delivery: Pair each function definition with a quick, hilarious visual gag. For instance, show the dragon on a 'territory map' of allowed dragon forms; if an input tries to go outside the map, it fails spectacularly. For 'one-to-one,' show the dragon transforming into distinct forms for distinct inputs, and then failing when two inputs try to map to the same output, making a mess.",
      "Start with a bang: The dragon attempts to transform into a simple object (e.g., a cup) via the machine, but it only half-works or produces something absurd, immediately establishing the comedic tone and hinting at transformation rules.",
      "Structure the script with a clear \"setup-punchline\" for each function concept, where the dragon's transformation attempt is the setup and the comical failure or unexpected result is the punchline, directly illustrating the mathematical principle.  For example, for domain/range, the dragon tries to become a cloud (outside the 'territory map') and turns into a rubber chicken.",
      "For even/odd functions, utilize mirror and rotational symmetry. Show the dragon transforming into a perfectly symmetrical form (even) versus one that's asymmetrical (odd). For periodic functions, have the dragon repeatedly transform into the same sequence of forms, like a looping animation.",
      "Composition as a sequence: Show the dragon transforming into an intermediate form, and then immediately using that form as the input for the next transformation via the machine. Make the intermediate form something funny.",
      "Periodic: Show the dragon transforming into a sequence of forms that repeat in a predictable pattern, like a cycle of different animal shapes, with each cycle taking a set amount of time or triggering a specific event.",
      "Dedicate 3-4 seconds to each function concept. Start with the 'dragon transformation machine' concept for transformation rules and domain/range, showing the dragon failing to become something outside its 'territory map'. Then, use quick cuts of the dragon transforming into unique forms for one-to-one, reaching all possible forms for onto, and a perfect pairing for bijections. For composition, show a chain reaction of transformations.",
      "Use rapid-fire audio cues and sound design to punctuate each transformation and explanation, enhancing the Family Guy-esque comedic rhythm and ensuring the audience stays engaged. Think distinct sound effects for successful vs. failed transformations, and zany musical stings for emphasis."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To make this concept engaging for Instagram within 35 seconds, we must leverage the inherent visual humor of a baby dragon's chaotic shape-shifting to illustrate each function concept, using the 'dragon transformation machine' and 'territory maps' as central, recurring gags. Each concept needs a distinct, rapid visual punchline delivered by the dragon's transformations.",
      "To maximize engagement for our 'Family Guy style baby dragon teaches functions' concept on Instagram, we must prioritize hyper-condensed, visually driven explanations. Each function concept needs a distinct, rapid gag built around the dragon's transformations and our core metaphors, ensuring clarity through absurdity and speed.",
      "To make this \"Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon shape-shifter teaches functions\" engaging on Instagram within 35 seconds, we must prioritize rapid-fire visual gags driven by the dragon's transformations, using the 'dragon transformation machine' and 'territory maps' as the central, hilarious anchors for each function concept. The key is extremely concise, punchy explanations that are instantly grounded in absurd, relatable visual humor."

    "The key to success is cramming multiple complex math concepts into a short, comedic format by making the visual metaphors the primary teaching tool and punchline. This aligns perfectly with Instagram's demand for quick, attention-grabbing content.",
    "The core challenge is distilling complex math into 35 seconds of Family Guy-esque humor. This requires an aggressive visual storytelling approach where every second counts, directly linking abstract ideas to concrete, funny dragon actions.",
    "The limited duration of Instagram Reels demands that every second counts, with visual humor and clear, rapid explanations being paramount. Audio-centric delivery will reinforce the comedic timing and ensure the math concepts land effectively amidst the chaos."
