The sound design should emphasize wonder and historical gravitas, mirroring the magical elements. Perfect sync between the visual cues of the eagle's glow, Ben-Gurion's declaration, and the ancestral spirits is paramount.",

A dynamic, emotional orchestral score that swells with the visuals, coupled with Ben-Gurion's deep, resonant voice, will create a truly immersive experience. Ensuring precise timing between audio cues and visual transformations is critical for maintaining audience engagement within the 64-second window.",

The voice acting for Ben-Gurion needs to be deeply resonant, conveying both the gravitas of his declaration and the warmth of a father figure returning his people home.",
