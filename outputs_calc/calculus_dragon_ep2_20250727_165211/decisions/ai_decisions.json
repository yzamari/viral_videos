    "reasoning": "The 'Family Guy style' description directly suggests a cartoon aesthetic. A baby dragon conductor on a magical number train with dialogue like 'CHOO CHOO!' and visual gags like 'magic epsilon tunnel' are perfectly suited for a vibrant, exaggerated cartoon style. Instagram and TikTok audiences respond well to such dynamic and visually engaging content.",

    "mission": "Family Guy style: Baby dragon conductor on magical number train! 'All aboard the SEQUENCE EXPRESS!' Each train car shows a term: a\u2081=1, a\u2082=1/2, a\u2083=1/3... CHOO CHOO! 'Watch the pattern - each term follows a rule!' The train heads toward LIMIT STATION at L=0. 'CONVERGENCE means we get closer and closer to L!' Dragon demonstrates: 'Pick ANY tiny distance \u03b5>0.' Magic epsilon tunnel appears! 'After some point N, ALL terms stay within \u03b5 of L!' Shows |a\u2099-L|<\u03b5 visually. 'The UNIQUE LIMIT THEOREM says only ONE destination possible!' Two tracks can't lead to different stations! BOUNDED sequences have safety rails - can't go to infinity. 'If -M \u2264 a\u2099 \u2264 M for all n, we're bounded!' ARITHMETIC OF LIMITS: Two trains approaching L and M. 'Their sum approaches L+M!' Product approaches L\u00d7M! Dragon makes sequence sandwich: If a\u2099 \u2264 b\u2099 \u2264 c\u2099 and outer sequences \u2192 L, then b\u2099 \u2192 L too! 'SQUEEZE THEOREM!' Epsilon chicks line up showing 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4... converging to 0!",
