1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,303
Hey kids, I am Epsilon the

2
00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:02,383
Dragon!

3
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:02,463
POOF!

4
00:00:02,463 --> 00:00:02,783
Natural numbers magically appear

5
00:00:02,783 --> 00:00:05,263
as delicious counting cookies.

6
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:06,503
But wait!

7
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:07,151
Integers arrive with a shiver,
representing

8
00:00:07,151 --> 00:00:08,439
negative temperatures.

9
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:09,083
WHOOSH!

10
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,015
Rational numbers flutter

11
00:00:11,015 --> 00:00:11,519
down as perfectly sized pizza slices.

12
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,783
Mind blown!

13
00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:15,311
Irrational numbers are like

14
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:15,951
infinite, shimmering dragons, stretching
endlessly.

15
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:16,079
Real

16
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,423
numbers create a beautiful, complete
number

17
00:00:20,423 --> 00:00:20,960
line.

18
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,640
Absolute value is a warm

19
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,056
dragon hug, always positive.

20
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:27,263
Intervals are

21
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:30,000
cozy nap zones on the number

22
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,452
line.

23
00:00:30,452 --> 00:00:32,712
Bounded sets are snug, secure

24
00:00:32,712 --> 00:00:33,160
cages.

25
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,400
Supremum is the tallest dragon

26
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,876
in the land!

27
00:00:36,876 --> 00:00:38,352
Completeness ensures there

28
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:41,880
are no gaps on our number

29
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:41,966
line.

30
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:42,826
My little Epsilon chicks chirp, "Epsilon
is greater than zero!

31
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:42,912
"
