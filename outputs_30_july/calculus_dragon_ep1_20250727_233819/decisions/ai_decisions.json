    "reasoning": "A 'Family Guy' style directly translates to a 'cartoon' visual style. This is ideal for Instagram as it allows for expressive character animation, vibrant colors, and visual metaphors.  The vibrant palette will make the content pop on a platform with a general audience, and the humor inherent in the requested style will drive engagement.",

    "primary_overlay_position": "bottom_center",
    "positioning_strategy": "static",
    "reasoning": "For Instagram, the 'bottom_center' position is a good balance. It keeps the overlay out of the top crucial content area and avoids the bottom 20% which is typically where Instagram UI elements might appear, ensuring the overlay remains visible and doesn't obstruct key parts of the cartoon.",

Cover natural numbers, integers, rational and irrational numbers, the real number line, absolute value, intervals, bounded sets, and supremum. Use visual metaphors: counting cookies for natural numbers, ice cubes for negative numbers, pizza slices for fractions, infinite spiral for irrational numbers. Make it funny and engaging for calculus students while teaching key concepts. The dragon should have a comedic personality and use humor to explain mathematical concepts.",
