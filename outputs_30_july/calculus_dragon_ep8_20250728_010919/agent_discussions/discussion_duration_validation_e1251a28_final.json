    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Dedicate specific visual gags to each concept: e.g., teleporting dragon for a sudden jump discontinuity, or a dragon consistently landing precisely in a small area for the epsilon-delta definition., Use distinct vocal tones and sound effects for the dragon and any other characters to enhance the comedic Family Guy feel and clearly demarcate dialogue segments., For the epsilon-delta definition, visualize the dragon trying to land within a tiny 'epsilon' landing zone, and the pilot explaining how precise controls (delta) are needed to avoid straying too far, even for a tiny error.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The biggest challenge will be cramming all these complex math topics, including the Cauchy criterion and continuity conditions, into a digestible, comedic format suitable for Instagram's format, especially within the tight duration. We need to ensure the analogies are crystal clear and the humor doesn't obscure the educational aspect.",
      "Balancing the comedic elements with accurate, albeit simplified, mathematical explanations will be challenging within a short Instagram video, risking either oversimplification or losing the audience.",
      "The biggest concern is the sheer volume of concepts to cover within an unknown, but likely very short, duration, making it difficult to give each topic sufficient comedic and explanatory depth without rushing the visuals or dialogue, thus potentially hindering comprehension."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "The Intermediate Value Theorem can be illustrated by the dragon needing to pass through a specific altitude range to reach a destination; if it's always flying smoothly, it's guaranteed to hit all altitudes within that range.",
      "Dedicate specific visual gags to each concept: e.g., teleporting dragon for a sudden jump discontinuity, or a dragon consistently landing precisely in a small area for the epsilon-delta definition.",
      "Ensure the dialogue is snappy and reflects Family Guy's comedic timing, with the dragon pilot's frustration or exaggerated enthusiasm driving the humor as he explains these concepts using these flight analogies. Each segment should transition seamlessly, maintaining momentum.",
      "For one-sided limits, show the dragon approaching an obstacle from the left vs. the right \u2013 its trajectory might be different depending on the approach, but the goal is to predict its path *as* it gets close.",
      "Use distinct vocal tones and sound effects for the dragon and any other characters to enhance the comedic Family Guy feel and clearly demarcate dialogue segments.",
      "Allocate specific flight metaphors to each concept: Epsilon-delta can be fine-tuning landing gear for a precise landing point (delta) within an acceptable flight path deviation (epsilon). One-sided limits can be approaching a landing strip from either the left or right. Continuity is a smooth, uninterrupted flight path. Discontinuities are abrupt teleports or crashes. The IVT is guaranteeing a specific altitude can be reached somewhere between two points.",
      "Use visual gags for discontinuities: a 'jump discontinuity' could be the dragon suddenly teleporting to a different altitude, while a 'removable discontinuity' might be the dragon briefly glitching out of existence before reappearing, but the underlying flight path is still smooth.",
      "For the epsilon-delta definition, visualize the dragon trying to land within a tiny 'epsilon' landing zone, and the pilot explaining how precise controls (delta) are needed to avoid straying too far, even for a tiny error."

    "consensus_points": [
      "For this Family Guy-style dragon pilot video on limits and continuity, the key is to inject humor and visual clarity, ensuring each concept is paired with a strong flight analogy.  The dialogue should be fast-paced and character-driven, leveraging the visual gags to reinforce abstract mathematical ideas, which is crucial for Instagram's short-form, engaging format.",
      "To make this Family Guy-style dragon pilot video engaging for Instagram, we need to prioritize punchy visuals and relatable flight analogies for each mathematical concept. The key is rapid-fire humor and clear, concise explanations that are instantly understandable, even if the viewer isn't a math whiz.",
      "To ensure this Family Guy-style dragon pilot video is engaging on Instagram and adheres to our dynamic timing, we must synchronize the mathematical concepts with punchy, character-driven dialogue and highly visual flight metaphors. Each concept, from epsilon-delta to the Intermediate Value Theorem, needs a rapid, comical flight analogy to maintain viewer interest and comprehension within the tight time constraints."

  "key_insights": [
    "The combination of a popular comedic style with relatable, visually dynamic analogies for complex math concepts offers high potential for virality on platforms like Instagram. Focusing on synchronized audio and visuals will maximize comprehension and entertainment within the tight duration.",
    "Instagram thrives on short, impactful content. By grounding abstract math concepts in concrete flight metaphors with a comedic Family Guy twist, we make it both entertaining and educational, increasing the likelihood of retention and shares.",
    "The core challenge is fitting a comprehensive list of calculus concepts into a very short, engaging format. By prioritizing visual humor and concise analogies that map directly to flight actions, we create an intuitive learning experience for Instagram's audience, crucial for maximizing engagement and retention."
