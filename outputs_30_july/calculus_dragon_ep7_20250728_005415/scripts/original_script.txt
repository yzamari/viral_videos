[VISUAL: Baby dragon sputtering, then transforming into a table. Stewie Griffin watching.] DIALOGUE: So, functions are like my magic transformation machine! Input a roar, get a chair. [VISUAL: Dragon transforming into a dog, then a cat. A map shows distinct territories.] DIALOGUE: The domain is all the things I can turn into. Range? Only the forms I actually make. [VISUAL: Dragon trying to turn into two different things simultaneously.] DIALOGUE: One-to-one means one input, one output. Onto means every possible output has an input, no leftovers! [VISUAL: Dragon transforming into a bird, then that bird transforming into a car.] DIALOGUE: Bijections are just perfect transformations. Function composition is like a transformation chain reaction! [VISUAL: Dragon morphing symmetrically, then a periodic, repeating wave pattern.] DIALOGUE: Even functions are mirror images, odd are rotational. And some transformations just repeat like a broken record!
