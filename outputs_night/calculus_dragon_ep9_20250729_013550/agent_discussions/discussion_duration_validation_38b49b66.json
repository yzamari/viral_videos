By leveraging the provided metaphors and comedy style, the complex mathematical topics can be made accessible and entertaining, crucial for a platform like Instagram.  Maintaining this balance is key to successful engagement within an unknown duration.",

        "Ensure the 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD' establishes the comedic tone and epic feel immediately, ideally incorporating sound effects that match the 'Family Guy' style for maximum impact within its 3-second duration.",
        "Craft short, sharp dialogue segments (1-2 sentences, ~10-15 words per sentence) that clearly link the treasure hunting actions to the mathematical concepts, using visual cues for each segment to reinforce learning.",
        "For the 'unknown duration', aim for a tight narrative that can easily be trimmed or slightly expanded. Prioritize the core explanations of Extreme Value Theorem, uniform continuity, and derivatives, ensuring a clear audio-visual sync throughout.",
        "Visually represent the 'derivative as instantaneous rate of change' by showing the dragon's speed at a specific point on its treasure-hunting path, perhaps using a speedometer or a dynamic graph overlay.",
        "The relationship between differentiability and continuity can be shown by a dragon smoothly flying over an unbroken treasure map (continuous) versus a dragon encountering a sudden chasm or missing piece (discontinuous/not differentiable).",
        "For the Heine-Cantor theorem and monotonic bijections, use visual metaphors like a consistently increasing treasure hoard's value or a predictable treasure-finding path to illustrate these concepts."

        "Develop distinct visual metaphors for each theorem. For the Extreme Value Theorem, perhaps a dragon finding the highest and lowest points of a mountain range. For uniform continuity, show a treasure map that doesn't change significantly when zoomed in slightly, ensuring consistent detail across the interval."
