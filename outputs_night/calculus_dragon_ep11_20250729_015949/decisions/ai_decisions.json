    "reasoning": "The prompt specifies the title card to be HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects. Placing it at the top center for the initial 3 seconds will ensure maximum visibility and impact for the title. For the rest of the video, a static top center position will keep the content clear and avoid interfering with the visual gags and mathematical explanations happening in the main frame, while adhering to Instagram's 'avoid bottom 20%' rule.",
