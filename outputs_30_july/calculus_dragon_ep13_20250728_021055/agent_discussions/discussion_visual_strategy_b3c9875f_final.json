    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Assign distinct visual identities to each stage of the function analysis, like 'Domain' being represented by a literal crime scene outline and 'Critical Points' as shadowy figures, each with a quick, punchy descriptor from the dragon., Incorporate visual gags that directly link to the mathematical concepts, such as the dragon's 'mood swings' visibly changing the color or texture of the function's graph to represent concavity changes, or 'asymptotes' appearing as invisible walls the dragon keeps bumping into., For the 'domain' step, visualize the dragon detective pulling out 'crime scene tape' that physically blocks off parts of the graph, with him exclaiming, 'This section's off-limits, rookie!'",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Ensuring the 'Family Guy' style humor lands effectively while simultaneously teaching complex mathematical concepts is a significant balancing act; the humor must not overshadow or confuse the educational content.",
      "The biggest concern is effectively conveying all the necessary calculus steps (domain, 1st/2nd derivative tests, inflection points, asymptotes, sketching) within the extremely tight 35-second duration without sacrificing clarity or the comedic timing.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the detail required for a complete function analysis with the need for extreme brevity and comedic pacing, ensuring no critical step is glossed over to the point of confusion.",
      "The primary concern is fitting the entire systematic function analysis into a concise, potentially under-35-second format without sacrificing clarity or comedic timing, especially when covering multiple calculus concepts like domain, derivatives, inflection points, and asymptotes."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Assign distinct visual identities to each stage of the function analysis, like 'Domain' being represented by a literal crime scene outline and 'Critical Points' as shadowy figures, each with a quick, punchy descriptor from the dragon.",
      "For the 'domain' step, visualize the dragon detective pulling out 'crime scene tape' that physically blocks off parts of the graph, with him exclaiming, 'This section's off-limits, rookie!'",
      "For concavity, use the dragon's 'mood swings' literally: a happy, upward curve (positive concavity) could be the dragon beaming, while a sad, downward curve (negative concavity) could be the dragon sulking, with quick cuts to show the transition.",
      "Assign a unique 'case file' visual for each function analysis step (domain, critical points, etc.) with the dragon detective physically interacting with it, like throwing a 'domain boundary' tape or interrogating a 'critical point suspect'.",
      "Make 'critical points' visually manifest as suspects who visibly 'shiver' (indicating a slope change) when the dragon detective hits them with his 'first derivative spotlight'. The second derivative test can then be the dragon's exaggerated 'mood swings' (happy face for concave up, frowny for concave down) affecting the background scenery.",
      "Incorporate visual gags that directly link to the mathematical concepts, such as the dragon's 'mood swings' visibly changing the color or texture of the function's graph to represent concavity changes, or 'asymptotes' appearing as invisible walls the dragon keeps bumping into."
    ],
    "consensus_points": [
      "To maximize engagement on Instagram for this Family Guy-style function analysis comedy, we must prioritize rapid-fire visual gags and clear, concise explanations delivered by the dragon detective, ensuring each mathematical concept is a 'clue' or 'suspect' within a mini-case file to keep the humor relevant and the narrative focused.",
      "To make this Family Guy-style math comedy engaging on Instagram, we need to compress each analytical step into rapid, visually distinct 'case file' segments, directly linking the dragon's detective actions to the function's properties. This ensures the humor lands and the educational content remains digestible within the 35-second constraint.",
      "To make the 'Family Guy style dragon detective function analysis' truly pop on Instagram within 35 seconds, we must synchronize each step of the analysis with a distinct, comedic visual gag that directly represents the mathematical concept. This ensures rapid engagement and memorable learning."

  "key_insights": [
    "The core challenge is balancing dense calculus concepts with the comedic pacing and visual density expected on Instagram within a strict 35-second window.  Prioritizing visual metaphors and rapid transitions will be key to conveying complex information entertainingly and memorably.",
    "Given the tight timeframe and platform, breaking down the systematic function analysis into bite-sized, visually driven gags tied to the detective narrative is crucial for both memorability and comprehension. Each step becomes a quick, punchy scene.",
    "The key is to translate abstract calculus concepts into tangible, funny visual metaphors that resonate with the Family Guy humor and fit Instagram's fast-paced consumption. Audio synchronization is paramount to delivering punchlines and explanations at the same pace as the visual gags."
