Ensure Epsilon's expressions of wonder and surprise are exaggerated for comedic effect.",

Utilize 'POOF!', 'WHOOSH!', and 'mind blown!' sound effects and corresponding visual distortions or character reactions to punctuate discoveries and maintain momentum. The 'infinite dragons' for irrational numbers should be a visual spectacle, perhaps fractal in nature, to maximize the 'mind blown' impact.",
        "For the final concepts like Supremum and Completeness, use clear, concise visual metaphors that resonate quickly. The 'tallest dragon' for Supremum and 'no gaps' for Completeness should be immediately understandable. The final '\u03b5 > 0!' chirp from Epsilon chicks should be a cute, memorable outro, reinforcing a key concept visually and audibly.",
