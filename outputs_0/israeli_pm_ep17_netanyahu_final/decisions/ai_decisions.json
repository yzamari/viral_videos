The visual descriptions like 'lightning effects', 'GLOW!', 'Dust effects', and 'Vibranium cracks' also align perfectly with the dynamic and often exaggerated visual language of comic books. For Instagram's general audience and creative/animated preference, a vibrant comic style would be highly engaging, allowing for bold storytelling and impactful visual metaphors.",

    "reasoning": "Instagram's safe zone is the top 80% of the screen. Placing the text in the top center allows for maximum visibility without obscuring any of the described visual elements, many of which are likely to occupy the middle and lower portions of the screen. This avoids the bottom 20% as per the rules and is a good balance for readability on a mobile feed.",
