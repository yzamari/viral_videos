Each narrative beat will be compressed into 5-7 second segments, using striking comic book panel aesthetics and impactful transitions. The visual strategy will focus on high contrast, bold colors, and exaggerated action to convey the emotional arc from defiance to despair, culminating in a chillingly effective post-credit sequence that leaves a lasting impression.",

We'll compress the narrative into tightly edited, impactful comic-style panels, using dynamic motion graphics and a strong, evolving soundscape to guide the viewer through a powerful arc of defiance, hope, chaos, and grim realization. This approach will maximize emotional impact and memorability within the platform's constraints, effectively delivering the mission's cautionary message.",

          "message": "To achieve the 'Marvel Comics epic: UNDERGROUND PANEL!' narrative on Instagram within 65 seconds, we must strategically sequence impactful, short visual segments (5-8 seconds each) with clear, concise subtitles and an evolving soundscape that mirrors the emotional arc. The 'WANTED' poster and thought bubble segments will establish defiance, followed by a 'Wakanda-style' dynamic for the Camp David summit and a visually arresting, slow-motion peace signing. The descent into chaos will be conveyed through rapid cuts, distorted audio, and a 'Thor-like breakdown' sequence, culminating in the Nobel Prize melting and a stark 'cave hermit' scene to drive home the 'terrorist to peacemaker to...' narrative, ending with a chilling, subtly escalating soundscape for the symbiote-like map.",
