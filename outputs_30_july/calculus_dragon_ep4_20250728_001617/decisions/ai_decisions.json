    "reasoning": "Family Guy style implies a cartoon aesthetic. A vibrant color palette will align with the show's often saturated and bold visuals, making the abstract mathematical concepts more engaging for a general audience on Instagram. This style is highly suitable for creative and animated content popular on the platform, and the 'funny' requirement is best met with a cartoon's expressive potential.",

    "primary_overlay_position": "top_center",
    "positioning_strategy": "static",
    "reasoning": "For Instagram, avoiding the bottom 20% is key. The top center offers a good balance of visibility without obstructing potential visual storytelling elements that might be presented lower on the screen in a cartoon format. It allows the main visual action to unfold without the overlay being a constant distraction.",

Teach monotonic convergence theorem, recursive sequences, the number e, nested intervals, subsequences, and Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Use visual metaphors: climbing/descending stairs, time loops for recursion, shrinking boxes for nested intervals. Make it funny while explaining how bounded monotonic sequences must converge.",
