    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds per major scene to capture its essence, ensuring the 'WANTED' posters, thought bubble, Camp David summit, and peace signing each have distinct audio signatures and visual impact. The 'FLUTTER!' sound effect for the doves needs to be sharp and transitional., For the 'Lebanon War Chaos' and 'Depression Spiral' segments, employ a significant shift in audio texture and rhythm. This could involve distorted sound effects, a rapid, jarring music cue, and possibly vocalizations that mimic Thor's breakdown, culminating in the 'Nobel Prize MELTS' visual with a visceral melting sound effect., The 'Cave Hermit' scene requires a stark audio contrast \u2013 silence or a very minimalist, echoing soundscape to emphasize isolation, with the caption delivered in a deep, resonant, almost world-weary voice. The post-credit 'symbiote spreading' map needs a subtle, unnerving ambient track that gradually intensifies.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Ensuring seamless transitions between diverse visual styles (comic panels, historical reenactment, abstract breakdown) within the tight timeline without appearing jarring or losing narrative coherence.",
      "Condensing complex historical and emotional shifts into 1-2 sentence script segments that remain evocative and readable as subtitles without sacrificing the epic feel.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the density of the narrative with the need for clear, digestible segments on Instagram. Cramming too much visual information or too many distinct plot points into short segments could dilute the impact.",
      "Ensuring the audio perfectly syncs with the visuals, especially during the slow-motion peace signing and the rapid descent into the 'Thor-like breakdown,' will be critical for maintaining the epic feel and avoiding a jarring experience.",
      "The primary concern is cramming the significant narrative progression \u2013 from initial rise to the 'depression spiral' and final 'symbiote' spread \u2013 into the tight 65-second window without feeling rushed or losing emotional depth. Each transition needs to be seamless and visually justified."

      "Utilize strong, stylized graphics for the 'WANTED' posters and thought bubbles, mirroring comic book conventions, and pair the Camp David summit with a dynamic, 'Wakanda-style' visual flourish to enhance the epic feel.",
      "Utilize a montage style for the 'Depression spiral' and 'Lebanon War Chaos' segments to convey intense emotion and action rapidly within 5-7 seconds each, supported by impactful sound design.",
      "Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds per major narrative beat (e.g., 'WANTED' posters, Camp David, Peace Signing) with transitions taking 1-2 seconds each, ensuring the total aligns with the 61.75-68.25 second target.",
      "Allocate roughly 6-8 seconds per major narrative beat to maintain momentum and hit the 65-second target, ensuring each segment feels impactful without overstaying its welcome.",
