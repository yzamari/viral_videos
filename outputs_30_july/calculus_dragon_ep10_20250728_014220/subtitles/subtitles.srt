00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,528
Welcome to the first ever Dragon Calculus
Olympics!

2
00:00:02,528 --> 00:00:03,160
The Chain

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:03,789
Rule Relay:

4
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:05,106
each dragonâ€™s output must match the next
dragonâ€™s

5
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:05,774
input!

6
00:00:05,774 --> 00:00:09,089
Inverse function derivatives are judged on
elegance and accuracy

7
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,448
in the gymnastics arena.

8
00:00:11,448 --> 00:00:14,535
Higher derivatives and critical points are

9
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:18,346
key in our treacherous mountain climbing
marathon.

10
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:19,851
Fermat's, Rolle's, and

11
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:25,193
Mean Value theorems are buried treasures
in our grand finale hunt
