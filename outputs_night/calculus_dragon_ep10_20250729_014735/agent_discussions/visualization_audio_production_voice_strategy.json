This requires a dynamic Olympic-style announcer who can deliver concise, punchy explanations while maintaining high energy, perfectly timed with sound effects that highlight the action and comedic beats. The overall audio must maintain a consistent, engaging tempo that builds throughout the 40 seconds.",
