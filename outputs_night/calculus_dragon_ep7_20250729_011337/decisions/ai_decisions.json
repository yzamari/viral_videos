    "reasoning": "A 'Family Guy' style comedy with a baby dragon shape-shifter teaching functions requires a cartoon aesthetic to be visually appealing and humorous for a general audience on Instagram. Vibrant colors will enhance the epic title card and make the abstract concepts more engaging and entertaining, fitting the platform's preference for creative, animated styles. The visual metaphors will also translate well within a cartoon style.",

    "positioning_strategy": "static",
    "reasoning": "The instruction specifies a 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects'. 'Top_center' is the most impactful position for a large title card to grab immediate attention without obstructing the primary visual content. It also aligns with Instagram's guideline to avoid the bottom 20% of the screen.",
