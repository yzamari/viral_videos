The audio for Professor Epsilon's explanations must be delivered with a rapid, slightly exaggerated academic tone that contrasts humorously with the chaos, ensuring educational clarity doesn't get lost in the Family Guy-esque action.",

Distinct, exaggerated sound effects for each number monster and the dragon's attacks, coupled with sharp, comedic dialogue, will drive the humor and memorability. Professor Epsilon's delivery should be quick and slightly nerdy, contrasting humorously with the epic action.",
