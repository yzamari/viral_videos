    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Script the dialogue and visuals for an immediate hook: Start with Maryam's impactful 'BREAKING NEWS' and the visual of the ghosted water, immediately establishing the satirical tone.  Allocate ~8 seconds for this intro., Execute the visual gag of water droplets with suitcases with exaggerated, comedic animation, followed by Peter Griffin's line delivered with perfect deadpan obliviousness. This rapid-fire exchange is a prime viral hook. Allocate ~10 seconds., For the remaining ~22 seconds, ensure a smooth transition to the 'citizens licking morning dew' visual, immediately followed by the 'Dew Licking Tutorial' lower third to end on a strong, absurd punchline that encourages shares and discussion.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is ensuring the visual storytelling, particularly the animation of the water droplets and the citizens' actions, lands with the intended darkly comedic tone without appearing gratuitous or detracting from the core news satire.",
