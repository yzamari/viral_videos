For the barrier, a series of quick exploding panels with a prominent 'KA-POW!' sound effect is essential.  During the UN speech, subtle energy effects emanating from Netanyahu will add to the visual spectacle.",

A powerful, resonant voiceover delivers: 'I am the GUARDIAN of Israel!' synced with a sonic boom.",

        "Segment 4 (15-25s): Shift to a dramatic depiction of Netanyahu speaking at the UN. Overlay subtle, pulsing energy effects emanating from him, amplifying his words. Keep dialogue brief and impactful.",
        "Segment 5 (25-35s): Rapid montage of futuristic cityscapes and advanced technology, symbolizing building a high-tech nation. Intercut with quick, assertive clips representing political comebacks.",
        "Segment 6 (35-45s): A powerful, close-up shot of Netanyahu, then a wide shot of the Israeli flag waving triumphantly. His voice booms: 'Bibi will return!' accompanied by an epic orchestral swell and final sonic flourish.",
