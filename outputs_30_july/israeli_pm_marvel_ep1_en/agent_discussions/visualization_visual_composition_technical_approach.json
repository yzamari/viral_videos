Each element, from Ben-Gurion bursting from the sand with his iconic hair to the vanishing British Mandate and exploding Declaration panels, must be delivered with impactful comic book sound effects and tight editing to maintain viewer attention within the 35-second window. The key is punchy visuals synchronized with iconic comic book audio cues.",
