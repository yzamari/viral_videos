Hey kids, I am Epsilon the Dragon! POOF! Natural numbers appear as counting cookies. But wait! Integers show up with negative temperatures. WHOOSH! Rational numbers as pizza slices. Mind blown! Irrational numbers are infinite dragons. Real numbers form a beautiful number line. Absolute value is like dragon hugs, always positive! Intervals are nap zones. Bounded sets are cages! Supremum is the tallest! Completeness means no gaps! Epsilon chicks chirp: Epsilon greater than zero!
