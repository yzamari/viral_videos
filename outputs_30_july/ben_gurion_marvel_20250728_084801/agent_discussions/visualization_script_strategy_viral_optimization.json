This approach taps into the viral appeal of unexpected historical reinterpretations and superhero tropes.",

Each scene should feel like a panel ripped from a dark, witty graphic novel, establishing him as an unlikely, earthbound superhero.",

          "message": "To maximize engagement for this Ben-Gurion Marvel-style intro on Instagram, we must anchor the dark humor in his legendary stubbornness and decisive actions, treating his nation-building as an origin story. The audio-visual synchronization is paramount, using dramatic sound effects to punctuate his 'powers' and a dry, commanding voiceover to deliver the witty cynicism.",
