The 64-second duration requires tight pacing, with each segment conveying significant information visually and audibly, while the 'epic music' and layered sound design will amplify the gravitas and 'magical' aura.",

The 'crystal tower' and 'floating spellbooks' will anchor the fantastical, while Netanyahu's 'magical armor' suit and the 'typhoon of controversies' will provide grounding for the narrative.",

The audio should feature a commanding, slightly reverberated voice for Netanyahu, punctuated by the ethereal shimmer of spellbooks and a growing orchestral score that builds to a dramatic crescendo, perfectly timed with visual montages.",
