The 'CHOO CHOO!' needs to be an iconic, slightly cartoonish sound.",

As the train enters the tunnel, the visuals and audio could distort slightly to represent getting 'within epsilon' of the limit, then snap back to normal upon exiting. The 'Sandwich theorem' could involve the dragon literally attempting to eat a sandwich made of 'epsilon chicks' and another sequence, highlighting the humor."
