1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,631
Behold, the young Rabin!

2
00:00:01,631 --> 00:00:05,519
A beacon of hope,

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,407
his Star of David

4
00:00:09,407 --> 00:00:10,469
shield gleaming brightly.

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:10,823
From

6
00:00:10,823 --> 00:00:11,832
soldier to statesman, a

7
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:13,560
remarkable transformation unfolds.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,136
A

9
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:16,080
new era dawns.

10
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,728
Entebbe!

11
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:18,648
Commandos launch a daring

12
00:00:18,648 --> 00:00:19,308
night raid.

13
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:19,968
The nation

14
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,432
faces a crippling economic

15
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:21,774
crisis;

16
00:00:21,774 --> 00:00:22,458
prosperity vanishes.

17
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:22,800
Scandal

18
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,262
erupts;

19
00:00:23,262 --> 00:00:24,647
betrayal is revealed.

20
00:00:24,647 --> 00:00:25,512
His shield falls;

21
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:25,800
'I

22
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,711
will return,' he vows.

23
00:00:26,711 --> 00:00:27,102
Post-credit:

24
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:28,271
A chilling grin;

25
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:31,223
a dark future looms.

26
00:00:31,223 --> 00:00:31,963
A future assassination casts a long
shadow.

27
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:32,279
To be continued...
