  "mission": "Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon shape-shifter teaches functions. Explain transformation rules, domain and range, one-to-one and onto functions, bijections, function composition, even/odd functions, and periodic functions. Use visual metaphors: dragon transformation machine, territory maps, mirror and rotational symmetry. Make abstract function concepts concrete and entertaining.",

    "original_script": "[VISUAL: Baby dragon sputtering, then transforming into a table. Stewie Griffin watching.] DIALOGUE: So, functions are like my magic transformation machine! Input a roar, get a chair. [VISUAL: Dragon transforming into a dog, then a cat. A map shows distinct territories.] DIALOGUE: The domain is all the things I can turn into. Range? Only the forms I actually make. [VISUAL: Dragon trying to turn into two different things simultaneously.] DIALOGUE: One-to-one means one input, one output. Onto means every possible output has an input, no leftovers! [VISUAL: Dragon transforming into a bird, then that bird transforming into a car.] DIALOGUE: Bijections are just perfect transformations. Function composition is like a transformation chain reaction! [VISUAL: Dragon morphing symmetrically, then a periodic, repeating wave pattern.] DIALOGUE: Even functions are mirror images, odd are rotational. And some transformations just repeat like a broken record!",
    "final_script": "Functions are like transformation machines. Input a roar, output a chair. The domain includes all possible inputs. The range is only the outputs created. One-to-one functions have one input for each output. Onto functions use all possible outputs; there are no leftovers. Bijections are perfect one-to-one and onto transformations. Function composition chains transformations together. Even functions are symmetrical; odd functions are rotationally symmetrical. Some functions repeat their output, like a broken record",
