00:00.000 --> 00:01.944
Baby dragon with a rocket pack!

00:01.944 --> 00:04.704
Let us explore the crazy limits

00:04.704 --> 00:05.416
of mathematics!

00:05.416 --> 00:06.840
Behold, the dragon shrinks!

00:06.840 --> 00:08.832
The Nth root of N approaches

00:08.832 --> 00:09.088
one.

00:09.088 --> 00:09.600
Magic stabilization!

00:09.600 --> 00:10.368
Zoom to infinity!

00:10.368 --> 00:11.264
Some sequences extend forever.

00:11.264 --> 00:11.712
Divergence, in

00:11.712 --> 00:13.848
the extended sense, is quite spectacular.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.976
The ratio your neighbors.

00:15.976 --> 00:17.040
See the

00:17.040 --> 00:18.320
dragon plants sprout and grow.

00:18.320 --> 00:18.576
If

00:18.576 --> 00:20.592
the ratio is less than one,

00:20.592 --> 00:21.560
we converge.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.496
Epsilon chicks multiply rapidly,

00:23.496 --> 00:24.840
showcasing divergence.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.528
Limits help us understand

00:27.528 --> 00:28.248
the infinite.

00:28.248 --> 00:29.688
The tiny dragon, flames

00:29.688 --> 00:34.824
sputtering, bravely navigates the
boundless expanse.

00:34.824 --> 00:38.760
Its rocket pack hisses, a miniature

00:38.760 --> 00:41.064
symphony of controlled chaos.

00:41.064 --> 00:42.216
The shrinking

00:42.216 --> 00:47.232
spell casts a shimmering, iridescent glow.

00:47.232 --> 00:50.976
Mathematical concepts unfold before us,
visualized

00:50.976 --> 00:54.036
by the dragon's fantastic journey.

00:54.036 --> 00:54.648
We

00:54.648 --> 00:55.662
witness the fascinating interplay of
convergence and divergence.

00:55.662 --> 00:56.802
The dragon's flight embodies the
exploration of infinity itself.

00:56.802 --> 00:57.816
It is a breathtaking spectacle of
mathematical wonder
