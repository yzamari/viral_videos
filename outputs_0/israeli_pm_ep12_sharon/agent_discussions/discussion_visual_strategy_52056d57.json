For example, the 'Juggernaut' entrance would feature heavy, percussive sound design and a booming voiceover., Utilize rapid cuts, evocative imagery (stock footage or animations) representing the 'Mysterio illusions' and 'Thanos Reality Stone' moments, and distinct audio cues for each character/event to maintain audience engagement and comprehension within the tight timeframe., Allocate approximately 7-8 seconds per segment, allowing for rapid visual storytelling and brief narration.
