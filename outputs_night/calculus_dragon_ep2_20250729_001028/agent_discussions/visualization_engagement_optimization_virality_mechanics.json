The core of engagement will come from the dragon conductor's rapid-fire, pun-filled explanations and the visual gags of epsilon and delta as inspectors, ensuring each mathematical concept is a laugh-out-loud moment.",

The animated title card must be immediately attention-grabbing, and the dragon conductor's persona should be amplified with Family Guy-esque humor, using the train as a prop for clear, albeit absurd, explanations of convergence, the Squeeze Theorem, and boundedness.  This will drive watch time and encourage shares by making complex ideas accessible and entertaining.",
