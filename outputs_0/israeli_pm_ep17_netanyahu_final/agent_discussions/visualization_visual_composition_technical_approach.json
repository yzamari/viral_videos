Each distinct 'panel' needs a strong, iconic visual cue and a concise on-screen text overlay or voiceover to convey its specific narrative point. The overall pacing should mimic a high-octane comic book narrative to maximize engagement within the 65-second duration.",

Each segment should be treated like a quick comic book splash page, delivered with impactful sound design and rapid transitions to maintain viewer interest within the 65-second limit. The key is to visually represent the exaggerated, often hyperbolic descriptions with clear, stylized graphics and effects that echo the Marvel aesthetic.",
