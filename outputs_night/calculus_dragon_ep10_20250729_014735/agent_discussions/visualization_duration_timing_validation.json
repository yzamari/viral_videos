The 3-second animated title card needs to be incredibly impactful, setting an epic yet comedic tone. Each calculus event must be clearly defined with a visual metaphor, and the sound design should amplify the excitement of the 'competition,' ensuring the audio perfectly syncs with the increasingly complex visual explanations.",

The 3-second title card must immediately convey the core concept and tone.  We'll maximize engagement by making the visual metaphors for each theorem incredibly dynamic and the competition itself the primary narrative driver, mirroring Family Guy's energetic pacing.",

Each calculus concept needs a distinct, visually striking Olympic event, and the Family Guy humor should be seamlessly integrated to boost shareability.  Given the target of 40 seconds \u00b15%, we need to allocate roughly 3-5 seconds per calculus concept after the initial title card.",
