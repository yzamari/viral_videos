Prioritize Marvel-style impact sounds for explosions and dragon fire., Ensure tight audio-visual synchronization between Epsilon's dialogue explaining number properties and the corresponding monster attacks; the audio cues for learning should be as impactful as the combat sounds., Create a distinct, memorable sound for Professor Epsilon's 'dragon fire' attack that can be used to transition between battles and reinforce his character. This sound should be impactful yet convey a hint of his academic nature.",
