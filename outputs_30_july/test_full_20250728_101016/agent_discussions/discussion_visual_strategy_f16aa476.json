Each power manifestation should be limited to 5-7 seconds, with a clear visual representation of the power, a corresponding sound effect, and a brief voiceover or subtitle explaining its 'purpose' in the founding narrative. This pacing aligns with the duration constraints and ensures each element is impactful."
