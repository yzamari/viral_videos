    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Design each calculus event as a distinct, short segment with clear visual metaphors: e.g., Chain Rule Relay Race with dragons passing a 'function' baton, Inverse Function Derivatives Gymnastics where a dragon performs a 'reciprocal' flip., Incorporate Family Guy-style comedic commentary or character interactions during the events to enhance relatability and humor, making abstract concepts more accessible and entertaining for a broader Instagram audience., For the Chain Rule event, imagine dragons performing a complex relay race where passing a 'value' requires a chain of precise transformations, with each dragon representing a derivative step. Use quick cuts and dramatic commentary. [VISUAL: Dragons in relay uniforms handing off a glowing orb] DIALOGUE: The Chain Rule relay is ON!",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is balancing the educational depth of calculus theorems with the fast-paced, humorous format required for Instagram virality. Overly complex explanations could alienate viewers, while too much humor might dilute the learning aspect.",
      "The biggest challenge is making potentially complex calculus theorems understandable and entertaining within short, digestible segments suitable for Instagram. Over-explaining could kill the humor and virality.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the educational integrity of the calculus concepts with the comedic and chaotic nature of Family Guy and the visual complexity of animating dragons competing. Over-simplification or convoluted visualizations could alienate viewers, while maintaining accuracy within the comedic framework is challenging.",
      "The \"Unknown Duration\" is a significant challenge. Without a clear end point, maintaining viewer retention requires a consistent delivery of novelty and humor, ensuring each segment is self-contained and engaging.",
      "Ensuring all specified calculus concepts are covered cohesively within the narrative without feeling like a disjointed list of math problems is crucial. The Olympic format must serve as a unifying element.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the humor and visual spectacle with accurate mathematical representation. Over-simplification could dilute the educational value, while overly complex visuals might alienate a broader audience."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "For Cauchy Mean Value Theorem, visualize a race between two dragons on slightly different tracks. The core idea is to show that at some point, their instantaneous rates of change (slopes) are equal, visualized by them momentarily being on parallel paths.",
      "Rolle's Theorem could be a synchronized swimming routine where dragons create a specific wave pattern, requiring them to reach the same height on opposite sides of the pool at some point, demonstrating the theorem's condition.",
      "Use a marathon for the Mean Value Theorems. Dragons run a set course; the theorems are proven by showing an average speed (or derivative value) achieved at some point during the race, visualized by a specific dragon's consistent pace.",
      "Incorporate on-screen text that briefly defines the calculus concept being visualized, keeping it concise and impactful for Instagram's fast consumption.",
      "For the Chain Rule event, imagine dragons in a relay race passing a flaming torch, where each leg of the race represents a derivative, with the speed of the pass being the rate of change.",
      "The inherent absurdity and educational twist offer significant viral potential. Focus on highly shareable moments of dragons excelling or failing comically while demonstrating calculus principles.",
      "Encourage sharing by ending with a call to action asking viewers which calculus event was their favorite or to tag friends who 'need a calculus refresher'.",
      "For Critical Points, picture dragons in a gymnastics routine where hitting specific high points or valleys in their aerial maneuvers signifies finding critical points. Scoring would be based on precision and reaching extreme positions. [VISUAL: A dragon performing a gravity-defying flip] DIALOGUE: Landing the critical point twist!",
      "Translate Inverse Function Derivatives into a dragon 'mirroring' event. One dragon performs a sequence, and another must perfectly mirror it in reverse, with their movements being inverse functions of each other.",
      "The critical points event could be a dragon attempting a complex gymnastic routine with sharp, sudden movements indicating extrema, visualized with graphs showing peaks and valleys.",
      "For the Chain Rule, visualize dragons in a relay race where each leg of the race represents a derivative, with baton passes symbolizing multiplication of derivatives. Each dragon must correctly calculate their leg's derivative to pass the 'torch'.",
      "For Higher Derivatives, imagine a dragon-diving competition. Each dive's complexity and accuracy are judged by successively higher derivatives of its trajectory, with increasingly elaborate maneuvers representing higher orders of calculus.",
      "Integrate sound design and quick cuts to maintain energy. Use Family Guy-style sound effects and comedic timing to punctuate the calculus explanations within the Olympic framework.",
      "Leverage the 'treasure hunting' metaphor for Fermat's Theorem, where dragons search for a specific point on a path. Finding the 'treasure' (peak or valley) is the objective, rewarding accuracy.",
      "Incorporate Family Guy-style comedic commentary or character interactions during the events to enhance relatability and humor, making abstract concepts more accessible and entertaining for a broader Instagram audience.",
      "Design each calculus event as a distinct, short segment with clear visual metaphors: e.g., Chain Rule Relay Race with dragons passing a 'function' baton, Inverse Function Derivatives Gymnastics where a dragon performs a 'reciprocal' flip.",
      "For theorems like Rolle's or Mean Value, choreograph a treasure hunt where the dragons must follow a specific path, and the theorem guarantees a certain 'stop point' or average speed.",
      "For the Chain Rule event, imagine dragons performing a complex relay race where passing a 'value' requires a chain of precise transformations, with each dragon representing a derivative step. Use quick cuts and dramatic commentary. [VISUAL: Dragons in relay uniforms handing off a glowing orb] DIALOGUE: The Chain Rule relay is ON!",
      "For Critical Points, depict dragons attempting complex gymnastics routines. The highest/lowest points in their routines represent local maxima/minima, with the challenge being to execute flawlessly or risk a humorous fall, illustrating the concept visually."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To maximize engagement for the 'Dragon Calculus Olympics' on Instagram, leverage the 3-second animated title card for immediate visual impact and introduce each calculus concept through dynamic, visually-driven Olympic events that mirror the Family Guy humor.  Ensure the unknown duration is managed by pacing segments with clear narrative arcs and impactful sound design to maintain viewer attention.",
      "To make this Dragon Calculus Olympics concept explode on Instagram, we need to lean into the absurd humor of Family Guy, visually translating each calculus theorem into a fast-paced, action-packed Olympic event with dragons. The unknown duration is a wildcard, so we'll need sharp editing and frequent visual gags to keep viewers hooked.",
      "To maximize engagement for the \"Dragon Calculus Olympics\" on Instagram, each calculus concept must be translated into a visually distinct, high-energy Olympic event featuring dragons, complete with Family Guy-esque humor and rapid pacing. The unknown duration necessitates tight editing and a compelling narrative thread to sustain viewer attention throughout the complex calculus demonstrations."
