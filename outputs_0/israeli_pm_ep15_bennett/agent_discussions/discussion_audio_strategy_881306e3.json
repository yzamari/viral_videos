This will reinforce the visual cues and maintain momentum., Optimize voiceover delivery: The voiceover needs to be energetic, clear, and slightly theatrical to match the comic book panel style. Each sentence should be delivered with precise timing to align perfectly with the visual and auditory cues, ensuring no wasted seconds and maximum impact., Allocate an average of 7-8 seconds per segment to ensure we can hit all narrative beats within the 65-second target (65s / 8 segments = 8.125s per segment).
