The 'mood swings' for concavity must be explicitly animated to directly correlate with the dragon's expressions and the function's shape, ensuring the educational content is both memorable and entertaining.",

The 3-second animated title card needs to be punchy and comedic, immediately establishing the Family Guy tone.
