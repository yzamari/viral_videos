The main body must balance rapid-fire visual gags and educational segments, ensuring each number set's characteristic is clearly linked to its monster persona and battle action.",

The visual design must integrate the Family Guy animation style with dynamic Marvel-esque motion graphics for maximum impact. The subsequent 32 seconds should feature rapid scene cuts between Epsilon's battles and humorous educational snippets, maintaining a high energy flow to retain viewer attention within the short timeframe.",
