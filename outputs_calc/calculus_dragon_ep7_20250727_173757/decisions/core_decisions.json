  "mission": "Baby dragon shape-shifting master! 'FUNCTIONS are transformation rules: f(x) takes input x, gives output f(x)!' Dragon machine: Put in 3, get out 9 for f(x)=x\u00b2. DOMAIN is dragon's territory - all allowed inputs. For f(x)=\u221ax, domain is [0,\u221e). RANGE is all possible outputs - where dragon can transform to! For f(x)=x\u00b2, range is [0,\u221e). ONE-TO-ONE (injective): 'Each input gets UNIQUE output!' f(x)=2x is one-to-one. f(x)=x\u00b2 is NOT (both 2 and -2 give 4). ONTO (surjective): 'Hit EVERY target in codomain!' f:\u211d\u2192\u211d with f(x)=x\u00b3 is onto. BIJECTION = both = perfect pairing! COMPOSITION is combo transformation! '(f\u2218g)(x) = f(g(x))' - apply g first, then f! Example: f(x)=x\u00b2, g(x)=x+1. Then (f\u2218g)(x)=f(x+1)=(x+1)\u00b2. EVEN functions have mirror symmetry: f(-x)=f(x). Like x\u00b2 or cos(x). ODD functions have rotational symmetry: f(-x)=-f(x). Like x\u00b3 or sin(x). PERIODIC functions repeat: f(x+T)=f(x). Sin and cos have period 2\u03c0. 'Functions at infinity: lim f(x) as x\u2192\u221e matches sequence limits!' Epsilon chicks map domain to range: 1\u21921, 2\u21924, 3\u21929 for f(x)=x\u00b2!",
