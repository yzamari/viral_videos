    "reasoning": "The prompt heavily emphasizes 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD', 'epic effects', 'EXPLOSIVE Family Guy comedy', 'epic fights, explosions, dragon fire', and 'Marvel-style action effects'. This all points towards a dynamic, energetic, and visually striking animation style. 'Cartoon' best encompasses these requirements, allowing for exaggerated physics, expressive character designs, and over-the-top action that aligns with the Family Guy and Marvel influences. Vibrant colors are essential for the explosive, high-energy feel. While 'anime' and 'comic' could also fit aspects, 'cartoon' is the most general and versatile choice for a broad Instagram audience looking for fun and action.",

    "reasoning": "The request specifies a 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD' that should appear at the beginning of the video. Instagram's 'avoid bottom 20%' rule is relevant, but for a title card that needs to be prominent and animated with 'epic effects', the top center provides the best visibility without obstructing potential action or character interactions that might occur lower down, especially with a cartoon style.",
