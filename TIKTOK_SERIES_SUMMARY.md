# TikTok Persian Nuclear News Series - Summary Report

## Overview
Generated TikTok versions of the Persian Nuclear News series with "In the Shadow of the Cypress" animation style.

## Episode Status

### Episode 1: Water Takes Flight
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Duration**: 17 seconds (target was 40s)
- **Script**: "بسم الله الرحمن الرحیم. This is Nuclear News. Our water flies away like birds..."
- **Issues**: Script was too short - AI generated minimal content
- **Sync**: Audio and subtitles properly synced
- **Generation Mode**: Cheap mode (text-based video)

### Episode 2: The Garden of Committees  
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Duration**: 17.7 seconds (target was 40s)
- **Script**: "Maryam: Government plants committee gardens. A minister waters a paper tree..."
- **Issues**: Script was too short - mission description interpreted too literally
- **Sync**: Audio and subtitles properly synced
- **Generation Mode**: Cheap mode (text-based video)

### Episodes 3-5
- **Status**: ❌ Not generated yet
- **Reason**: Paused due to duration issues with first two episodes

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Duration Problem**: 
   - Target: 40 seconds per episode
   - Actual: ~17 seconds per episode
   - Root Cause: AI is generating very short scripts when given detailed visual descriptions

2. **Script Generation**:
   - The mission descriptions are being interpreted as complete scripts
   - AI is not expanding the content to fill the requested duration
   - Need to provide clearer instructions to generate fuller scripts

3. **Visual Style**:
   - Using cheap mode (text-based) instead of VEO due to time constraints
   - "In the Shadow of the Cypress" style not achieved with text-only video

## Recommendations

1. **Script Generation Fix**:
   - Provide more narrative content in mission descriptions
   - Explicitly request script expansion to meet duration requirements
   - Separate visual instructions from narrative content

2. **Duration Fix**:
   - Use `--min-duration` flag if available
   - Provide more detailed story outlines
   - Request AI to expand on themes and add more content

3. **Visual Quality**:
   - Use `--no-cheap` flag for VEO generation with proper visual style
   - Allow more time for VEO clip generation (10+ minutes per episode)

## Next Steps

1. Fix script generation to achieve 40-second target duration
2. Run remaining episodes (3-5) with improved script generation
3. Consider re-running episodes 1-2 with proper duration
4. Test with VEO generation for authentic visual style

## Technical Notes

- Theme: Nuclear News with Persian overlay branding
- Character: Maryam (news anchor)
- Visual Style: "In the Shadow of the Cypress" (watercolor, flat 2D, earth tones)
