The 3-second title card needs to be exceptionally impactful, blending epic visuals with a humorous tone to immediately capture attention and set the stage for the high-energy competition.",

The 3-second title card needs to be an explosion of epic effects and fiery dragon animation, immediately setting a humorous yet grand tone. Each calculus concept must be distilled into a hyper-condensed, visually intuitive Olympic event, leveraging clear metaphors like a relay for chain rule or gymnastics for higher derivatives, ensuring the Family Guy humor lands even with rapid transitions.",

The 3-second title card must be an audio-visual explosion, and the subsequent 37 seconds must deliver rapid-fire, distinct Olympic events for each theorem, prioritizing clear, comedic action over lengthy explanations.",
