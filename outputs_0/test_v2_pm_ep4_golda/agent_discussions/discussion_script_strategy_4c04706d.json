The overall duration should be meticulously managed, aiming for approximately 7-8 seconds per major action panel to fit within the 61.75-68.25 second target, allowing for transitions and the final impactful statement., Segment Timing: Allocate an average of 8.125 seconds per segment (65 seconds / 8 segments) to ensure all key visual and narrative beats are delivered within the target duration.
