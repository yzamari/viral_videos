    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For Chain Rule: A dragon relay race where each dragon's 'hand-off' (derivative) depends on the previous one's speed, with quick cuts to animated function compositions. For Inverse Derivatives: A dragon performing a complex aerial stunt, then a reverse stunt by another dragon with synchronized audio explaining the reciprocal relationship. For Higher Derivatives: A dragon performing increasingly complex loops and spins, each layer representing a higher derivative. For Critical Points/Fermat's Theorem: Dragons climbing impossibly steep, jagged peaks, pausing at the absolute summit. For Rolle's Theorem: Two dragons finishing a race at identical altitudes, implying a moment of zero vertical speed in between. For Lagrange MVT: A dragon marathon runner whose average speed is highlighted by a dashed line matching a specific instantaneous speed. For Cauchy MVT: Two dragons on slightly different, but related, race tracks, comparing their average speeds to find a common instantaneous speed., Ensure each concept segment is no more than 3-4 seconds, with quick visual setup, the mathematical demonstration, and a final punchline or identifier for the theorem/rule. Use Family Guy's iconic character voices for commentary or reactions to amplify the humor and brand recognition., Segment the 35 seconds into 7 distinct, ultra-short clips (approx. 5 seconds each), dedicating one to each calculus concept. Use iconic Family Guy characters like Peter or Brian as commentators for the events to amplify the brand recognition and humor. For example, Peter can hilariously misinterpret the math while the visual clearly demonstrates it.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is the sheer density of mathematical concepts to cover. Fitting all seven theorems and rules, each with a unique visual metaphor and explanation, into 35 seconds risks overwhelming the audience or oversimplifying to the point of inaccuracy.  Each concept needs to be instantly digestible.",
      "The primary concern is cramming seven distinct calculus concepts, each requiring a unique visual metaphor and explanation, into a 35-second video without feeling rushed or sacrificing clarity. Oversimplification for brevity could dilute the mathematical concept, and the 'Family Guy' humor needs to be integrated seamlessly rather than feeling tacked on.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all seven complex calculus concepts into 35 seconds without feeling rushed or sacrificing clarity. Ensuring each metaphor is distinct and the mathematical explanation is concise yet accurate will be challenging.",
      "The humor must be integrated seamlessly without overshadowing or confusing the calculus concepts. Visualizing abstract theorems like Cauchy's MVT in a relatable, funny way within the Family Guy universe is critical."

      "For the technical approach, adopt a 'fast-cut' editing style, mirroring the pacing of the Family Guy show. Utilize dynamic camera angles within the animation for the Olympic events and employ bright, saturated colors consistent with the show's aesthetic.  Animated text overlays should be bold, easily readable, and appear only during crucial moments of explanation for each theorem.",

      "For each calculus concept (Chain Rule, Inverse Derivatives, Higher Derivatives, Critical Points, Fermat's, Rolle's, Lagrange, Cauchy), allocate approximately 3-4 seconds of screen time. Use distinct, exaggerated Family Guy character voiceovers for each. For example, Peter Griffin could humorously misinterpret the Lagrange Mean Value Theorem during a marathon.",
      "Emphasize synchronized sound effects and visual cues. For the Chain Rule relay, the sound of passing a baton should coincide with the visual of a composite function's derivative. For inverse function derivatives, a 'rewind' sound effect can punctuate the reversed gymnastics routine."

      "To make this 'Family Guy Olympics: Calculus Edition' engaging for Instagram, we must leverage the rapid-fire, visual humor of the show to explain each calculus concept concisely.  Each of the seven calculus topics needs a distinct, high-energy Olympic event that acts as a clear visual metaphor, synchronized with extremely brief, punchy dialogue and overlaid text for maximum comprehension in 35 seconds.",
      "To make this Family Guy Olympics calculus special engaging on Instagram, we must prioritize extreme visual clarity and rapid-fire humor for each concept. Each of the seven calculus topics requires a distinct, highly energetic Olympic event that serves as an immediate, intuitive metaphor, synced perfectly with ultra-brief, punchy dialogue and on-screen text to maximize comprehension within the 35-second limit.",
      "To make the Family Guy calculus Olympics engaging on Instagram, we must synchronize the visual metaphors for each theorem with rapid, comedic Family Guy-style dialogue and sound design. Each concept needs a distinct, short Olympic event that intuitively explains the calculus rule, ensuring quick comprehension for the 35-second format."

    "The core challenge is fitting numerous complex calculus concepts into a short Instagram format.  Prioritizing distinct visual metaphors tied to the Family Guy aesthetic and Olympic events will ensure clarity and entertainment, making the educational content accessible and shareable.",
    "The core challenge is distilling complex calculus theorems into 1-2 second visual gags understandable by a broad Instagram audience, while maintaining the show's comedic tone.  This requires a 'less is more' approach to explanations and a hyper-focus on the visual translation of each concept into a Family Guy-esque Olympic event.",
    "Given the platform and duration, the visual metaphors must be instantly understandable, with audio cues reinforcing the mathematical principle in a humorous, 'Family Guy' context. This approach maximizes engagement by balancing education with entertainment within tight constraints."
