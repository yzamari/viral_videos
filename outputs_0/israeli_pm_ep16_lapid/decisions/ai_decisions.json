    "reasoning": "The content is highly visual and fast-paced, with many distinct elements. Placing the primary overlay on the bottom left allows it to be present without obscuring key action or dialogue in most panels. A dynamic strategy is chosen because the exact placement might need minor adjustments between the numerous quick cuts to ensure readability and avoid clashes with specific imagery, while still generally adhering to the bottom left.",
