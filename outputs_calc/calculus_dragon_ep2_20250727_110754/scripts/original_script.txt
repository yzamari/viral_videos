All aboard the Sequence Express! Each car is a term: a₁, a₂, a₃... CHOO CHOO! Where are we going? To the limit, of course! This train is on a journey. The train approaches station L. Convergence means getting closer and closer. Through the Epsilon tunnel, we get within epsilon of L! That is quite a feat. The unique limit theorem states there is only one destination. No detours allowed! Bounded sequences stay on track, never going too far off. They are reliable travelers. The arithmetic of limits: Add, multiply, it all works perfectly. Mathematical magic! Behold, the Sandwich theorem: Dragon sandwich with sequences! Epsilon chicks form a convergent sequence!
