# ViralAI Unified Architecture Documentation

## 🚀 Overview

ViralAI is a state-of-the-art AI-powered video generation platform that creates consistent, high-quality content across multiple platforms. The system leverages cutting-edge AI models, intelligent agent orchestration, and character consistency technology to produce professional videos ranging from short-form social media content to full-length movies.

**Version**: v3.11.0  
**Status**: Production-Ready  
**Last Updated**: September 2025

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### 1. **Centralized Decision Framework**

All decisions are made upfront via the `DecisionFramework` before any generation begins:

```
CLI Input → Decision Framework → Core Decisions → All Components
```

**Key Components:**
- `DecisionFramework` - Central decision-making system
- `CoreDecisions` - Immutable data structure containing all system decisions
- Decision sources: CLI, config files, AI agents, system defaults

### 2. **Character Consistency System** 🎭

**State-of-the-art character generation using:**

#### Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (nano-banana)
- Character-consistent image generation ($0.039/image)
- Identity preservation across transformations
- Multi-image blending for complex scenes
- Style transfer capabilities

#### Enhanced Veo 3 Integration
- Reference-powered video generation
- Up to 3 character reference images per video
- Native audio integration with dialogue
- 8-second clips with perfect character consistency

#### Character Management Pipeline
```python
Character Creation → Reference Generation → Scene Production → Video Synthesis → Consistency Validation
```

**Implementation:**
- `EnhancedCharacterManager` - Complete character lifecycle management
- `GeminiFlashImageClient` - Character-consistent image generation
- `EnhancedVeo3Client` - Reference-powered video generation

### 3. **LangGraph Agent System** 🤖

**Intelligent multi-agent orchestration with state management:**

#### Key Features
- **State Graphs**: Maintain conversation context across interactions
- **Dynamic Routing**: Agent selection based on discussion phase
- **Checkpointing**: Save and resume complex workflows
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple agents concurrently

#### Specialized Agents
1. **Creative Director** (Alexandra Vision) - Vision and strategy
2. **Script Writer** (Marcus Narrative) - Story and dialogue
3. **Character Designer** (Sofia Identity) - Character consistency
4. **Visual Director** (Kai Aesthetic) - Cinematography and aesthetics
5. **Consensus Builder** (Harmony Synthesis) - Team alignment

**Implementation:** `LangGraphAgentSystem` with SQLite checkpointing

### 4. **AI Service Architecture**

#### Universal AI Provider Interface
Seamless switching between providers without code changes:

```python
AIServiceManager → Provider Selection → Unified Interface → Response
```

**Supported Providers:**
- Google (Gemini, Vertex AI, Veo)
- OpenAI (GPT-4, DALL-E)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Custom providers via adapter pattern

#### Provider Features
- Automatic fallback on failures
- Load balancing across providers
- Cost optimization
- Provider-specific feature support

### 5. **Video Generation Pipeline**

#### Three-Stage Production Pipeline

**Stage 1: Pre-Production**
- Agent discussion and planning
- Character profile creation
- Script development
- Visual planning

**Stage 2: Production**
- Character reference generation (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- Scene-specific image creation
- Video clip generation (Veo 3)
- Audio synthesis and dialogue

**Stage 3: Post-Production**
- Clip stitching and transitions
- Audio mixing and synchronization
- Consistency validation
- Final rendering

### 6. **News Aggregator System**

**Enhanced news video creation with real media:**

- **Universal Scraper**: Configurable web scraping via JSON
- **Multi-Source Support**: Web, Telegram, CSV, RSS
- **Real Media Integration**: Use actual images/videos when available
- **Multi-Language**: Including RTL support (Hebrew, Arabic)

**Configuration:** `scraper_configs/` directory with JSON definitions

## 💼 Business Features

### Platform-Specific Optimization
- **TikTok**: Vertical format, trending audio, quick cuts
- **YouTube**: Horizontal format, longer content, SEO optimization
- **Instagram**: Square/vertical, stories, reels
- **LinkedIn**: Professional tone, business focus

### Theme System
- Pre-built themes (News, Sports, Tech, Entertainment, University)
- Custom theme creation
- Logo overlay integration
- Brand consistency

### Content Types
- **Short-form**: 15-60 second social media videos
- **Long-form**: Full movies and series episodes
- **Live-style**: News broadcasts and interviews
- **Educational**: Tutorials and explanations

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### SOLID Principles Compliance

**Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
```python
CharacterManager - manages characters only
VideoGenerator - generates videos only
AgentOrchestrator - orchestrates agents only
```

**Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
```python
class AgentInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState
    
# New agents extend without modifying base
class NewSpecializedAgent(AgentInterface):
    def process(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState
```

**Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes are substitutable
**Interface Segregation**: Specific interfaces for different needs
**Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Microservices Architecture

Each component can be deployed independently:

```yaml
services:
  character-service:
    port: 8001
    endpoints: [/characters/create, /characters/reference]
    
  agent-service:
    port: 8002
    endpoints: [/discussions/start, /discussions/state]
    
  video-service:
    port: 8003
    endpoints: [/videos/generate, /videos/status]
```

### Cost Optimization

**Estimated costs for 60-minute movie:**
- Character creation: $1.95
- Scene generation: $17.55
- Video production: $45.00
- **Total: ~$65**

**Optimization strategies:**
- Reference caching and reuse
- Batch processing for similar scenes
- Smart provider selection
- Preview generation before final render

    output_path="hero_scene.mp4"
)
```
