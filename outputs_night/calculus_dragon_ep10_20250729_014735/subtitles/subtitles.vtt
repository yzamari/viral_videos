00:00.000 --> 00:02.638
Welcome to the Dragon Calculus Olympics

00:02.938 --> 00:06.099
Dragons compete in thrilling calculus
challenges

00:06.399 --> 00:09.586
They master the chain rule in a blazing
relay race

00:09.886 --> 00:14.040
Inverse function derivatives are judged in
gravity-defying gymnastics

00:14.340 --> 00:18.336
Higher derivatives and critical points are
conquered in a mountain marathon

00:18.636 --> 00:23.782
Fermat's, Rolle's, Lagrange, and Cauchy
theorems are found in epic treasure hunts

00:24.082 --> 00:27.661
Witness breathtaking aerial maneuvers and
intense competition

00:27.961 --> 00:31.122
Feel the thrill of victory and the agony
of defeat

00:33.995 --> 00:35.849
The suspense is palpable

00:36.149 --> 00:40.146
This is the ultimate test of mathematical
prowess and athleticism

00:40.446 --> 00:43.555
Dragons push their limits, soaring to new
heights

00:43.855 --> 00:45.631
