        "Incorporate a 'Dragon's Calculus Secret Scroll' as a visual aid for each theorem, with each 'technique' taught by a wise old ninja master dragon. This reinforces the visual metaphor and makes the learning process more engaging.",

        "Visually represent '0/0' as a dragon attempting to breathe fire but only producing smoke, then 'solving' it with L'H\u00f4pital's rule like a quick sword slash. Similarly, 'infinity/infinity' could be a dragon endlessly climbing a mountain of scrolls, only to discover a shortcut technique.",

      "concerns": [
        "The primary concern is ensuring the calculus concepts, while simplified and humorous, remain accurate enough not to be misleading. Overly complex jokes might alienate viewers who aren't familiar with the concepts, and overly simplified jokes might not satisfy those who are."
