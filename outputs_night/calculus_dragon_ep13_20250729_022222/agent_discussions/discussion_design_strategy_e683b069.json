      "message": "For this 'Dragon Detective Agency' episode, the visual design must perfectly blend Family Guy's comedic aesthetic with the systematic nature of function analysis. The 3-second animated title card needs to be impactful with 'epic effects' that hint at both dragons and investigation, setting a strong visual tone. Subsequent visuals should use clear, engaging metaphors like a detective examining clues for domain, or a dragon's 'mood swings' representing concavity, all within the 40-second Instagram timeframe.",

      "suggestions": [
        "Create a bold, retro-inspired animated title card for 'Dragon Detective Agency' using dynamic fonts and fiery dragon animation to immediately capture attention. The 'epic effects' could involve glowing scales or a powerful roar morphing into the title.",
        "For visual metaphors, depict the dragon detective meticulously 'dusting for prints' on the function's graph to find critical points, or 'interrogating' the second derivative graph to determine inflection points and concavity, aligning with the investigation theme."
