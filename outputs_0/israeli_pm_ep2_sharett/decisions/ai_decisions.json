    "reasoning": "The 'Marvel intro' and 'Spider-Man style inner monologue' directly reference comic book aesthetics. The descriptions of characters materializing, papers flying in slow-mo, and dramatic villain reveals are all hallmarks of comic book paneling and visual storytelling. A vibrant color palette aligns with the energetic and often bold visuals of Marvel comics, suitable for a general audience on Instagram.",

    "reasoning": "The content describes a narrative with a strong visual focus on the character's presence and actions. Placing the overlay at the top_center allows for a clear view of the visual gags and character interactions without obstructing any essential parts of the 'Marvel intro', 'Montage', or 'Villain reveal'. Given Instagram's UI, avoiding the bottom 20% is crucial, and the top_center provides ample space. The 'Spider-Man style inner monologue' also lends itself well to being read at the top of the screen.",

Montage of being overshadowed, papers flying past him in slow-mo. Spider-Man style inner monologue: 'With great responsibility comes... being ignored by history.' Shows diplomatic skills like Doctor Strange's hand movements creating peace treaties. Villain reveal: Ben-Gurion's shadow literally consuming screen. Post-credit: Still in office, checking watch, 'Is it 1955 yet?' Stan Lee cameo as confused citizen: 'Who's the Prime Minister again?'",
