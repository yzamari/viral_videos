Synchronize each 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', 'WHAM!' with its corresponding visual and a distinct, impactful sound effect., Craft a tight audio mix where the voiceover and sound effects complement each other. Ensure the 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' lines are delivered with a commanding, slightly over-the-top tone that fits the Marvel theme, and sync them precisely with Netanyahu's visual presence., Allocate roughly 7-10 seconds maximum per described action (e.g., Knesset crash, opposition vanishing, coalition deals exploding) to ensure we can fit all elements and meet the 55-second target.",
