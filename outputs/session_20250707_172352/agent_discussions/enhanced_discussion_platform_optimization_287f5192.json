        "Ensure the video is produced in a vertical 9:16 aspect ratio, optimized for the YouTube Shorts player.",
        "Implement an immediate visual or auditory hook within the first 1-2 seconds to maximize initial retention and grab attention.",
        "Focus on extreme punchy delivery for the comedy to ensure high watch-through rates and potential loopability, making the 10 seconds feel impactful.",
        "Consider leveraging trending audio from the YouTube Shorts library if it complements the comedic timing and enhances discoverability.",
