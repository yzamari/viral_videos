  "target_outcome": "Achieve a 15% engagement rate (likes, comments, shares) and a 5% increase in follower count within 24 hours of posting the Instagram video.",
  "strategic_approach": "Employ a fast-paced, visually dynamic narrative structure that leverages humor, irony, and a surprising climax to engage the audience and leave a memorable impression.  The emotional arc will move from initial intrigue to intense action, culminating in a powerful, unexpected conclusion.",
