This approach prioritizes a strong emotional arc, building from heroism to betrayal and ominous foreshadowing, all within the tight timeframe.",

By synchronizing sharp audio cues with each panel's visual transformation and narrative reveal, we create an immersive, punchy experience that drives the story forward effectively within the given duration. The rapid pacing mirrors comic book action, making the narrative compelling and memorable.",

        "Allocate approximately 5-7 seconds per key narrative beat (e.g., Rabin's introduction, transformation, Entebbe rescue, economic crisis, scandal, resignation, post-credit tease). Ensure sound design complements each visual, with distinct SFX for morphing, WHOOSH, SNAP, SHOCK, CLANG, and a rising ominous tone.",
