The core of the 40-second Instagram video should focus on fast-paced, humorous visual explanations of the convergence tests, leveraging the 'Dragon astronaut' character and space station setting for comedic effect and relatable analogies.",

The main 40 seconds will thrive on fast-paced, visually clear analogies using a bright, energetic palette. The Family Guy style allows for exaggerated physics and humor, making the math concepts inherently engaging.",

          "message": "For 'EPISODE 3: To Infinity and Beyond!!', the 3-second title card needs to be an explosion of cosmic chaos and humor, mirroring Family Guy's style. The subsequent 37 seconds must maintain this energy, using the dragon astronaut to visually narrate the convergence tests with quick, punchy gags and clear, exaggerated math demonstrations. The key is rapid visual storytelling that makes abstract concepts feel tangible and hilariously alien.",
