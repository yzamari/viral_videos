00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,492
This just in:

2
00:00:00,492 --> 00:00:00,984
Tehran has gone

3
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:02,016
full Mad Max.

4
00:00:02,016 --> 00:00:03,048
Peter Griffin-style warriors

5
00:00:03,048 --> 00:00:06,192
fight for the last water bottle.

6
00:00:06,192 --> 00:00:06,512
Witness me!

7
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:07,152
This precious water is

8
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:07,823
mine now.

9
00:00:07,823 --> 00:00:09,167
This reminds me of

10
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:10,735
my novel about drought.

11
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:11,519
Oh dear,

12
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,823
I have been hit by a

13
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:14,656
water truck.

14
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:16,320
There is no water

15
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,519
to wash my hijab anyway.

16
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:18,960
It

17
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,304
is a chicken fight out there

18
00:00:20,304 --> 00:00:20,880
with dehydration.

19
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,456
Iran International:

20
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:22,032
We are

21
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:23,132
as thirsty as you are!

22
00:00:23,132 --> 00:00:23,352
Water

23
00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:23,504
apocalypse.

24
00:00:23,504 --> 00:00:23,960
This just in:

25
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,264
Tehran has

26
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:25,704
gone full Mad Max.

27
00:00:25,704 --> 00:00:26,424
Peter Griffin-style

28
00:00:26,424 --> 00:00:29,352
warriors fight for the last wat
