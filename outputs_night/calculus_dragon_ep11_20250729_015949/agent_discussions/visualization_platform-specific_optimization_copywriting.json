The 3-second animated title card is crucial for hook, and the Family Guy style comedy needs to be packed into digestible, meme-able segments that explain calculus concepts visually.  Focus on making the math lessons as punchy and visually engaging as the comedy.",

We must break down the calculus concepts into ultra-short, visually-driven segments, using the ninja metaphors to explain Darboux Theorem and L'H\u00f4pital's Rule for indeterminate forms like 0/0 and \u221e/\u221e. The key is to make the math as visually explosive and funny as the Family Guy style demands.",
