        "Implement exaggerated sound effects for the 'Peter Griffin-style warriors' fighting, including grunts, impacts, and the distinct 'WITNESS ME!' shout with heavy reverb. For the Brian character, a subtle, thoughtful ambient sound that's abruptly cut off by the water truck's impact will enhance the joke.",
        "Ensure Maryam's dialogue has a clear progression of distress, culminating in a spoken line delivered with a mix of resignation and absurdity. The final Persian title card should have a somber, atmospheric sound bed, perhaps with a dripping water sound effect, to tie into the 'thirsty' theme."

Also, any music bed used should be dynamic enough to shift tone with the comedic beats."
