  "script_content": "Behold, a baby dragon perched atop an endless staircase! Monotonic means always ascending or always descending. This dragon is never falling. Bounded and monotonic implies convergence. The dragon is trapped, caught in a time loop! Each step in this recursive sequence depends on the previous one. We can determine the limits of these sequences. It mirrors the dragon's journey. The number *e* symbol of natural dragon growth, a key mathematical constant. Observe Cantor's dragon boxes, each smaller than the last. Subsequences are like the dragon's kin, related yet distinct. The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem assures bounded sequence possesses a convergent subsequence. The dragon always finds its way",
