The visual approach should lean into a high-contrast, dynamic comic book aesthetic, ensuring each action sequence\u2014from the Tel Aviv skyline burst to the vanishing tunnels\u2014is punchy and visually distinct.",

This means meticulously synchronizing iconic comic book sounds like 'whooshes,' 'crackles,' and 'KAPOW!' directly with Benjamin Netanyahu's powerful declarations and key visual cues to create an undeniable audio-visual synergy that captures attention instantly and maintains momentum throughout the 50-second duration.",
