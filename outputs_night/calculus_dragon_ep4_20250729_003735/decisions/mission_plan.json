  "mission_statement": "EPISODE 4: Dragon Stairs & Time Loops!! Show this as HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects! Family Guy time-travel comedy! Dragon discovers a MATHEMATICAL TIME MACHINE powered by the number e! Each recursive step takes him through mathematical history, meeting famous mathematicians. Monotonic sequences are elevator operators, Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem is a helpful time guide, and nested intervals are time portals. Dragon hilariously explains each concept while time-traveling. Include funny historical encounters, dragon's time-travel jokes, and visual demonstrations of recursive concepts!",
