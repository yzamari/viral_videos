    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Map L'H\u00f4pital's Rule to a 'divide and conquer' ninja move, slicing indeterminate forms like '0/0 demons' with a 'derivative blade.', Visualize Darboux Theorem as a 'secret scroll' that, when opened, reveals a 'double derivative' technique, perhaps performed with synchronized kicks., Use quick cuts between the dragon's humorous attempts at calculus and the master's dramatic reveals of 'advanced limit techniques' as ultimate moves.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is ensuring the visual metaphors for Darboux Theorem and advanced limits are immediately understandable within their brief time allocation, avoiding confusion with the more visually straightforward L'H\u00f4pital's Rule.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all three complex calculus concepts (Darboux, L'H\u00f4pital's for multiple forms, advanced limits) into 35 seconds without sacrificing clarity or comedic impact. Each needs a very brief, yet distinct visual and dialogue snippet.",
      "The primary concern is cramming three distinct calculus concepts (Darboux, L'H\u00f4pital for multiple forms, advanced limits) into 35 seconds without sacrificing clarity or humor. Overly complex explanations for indeterminate forms will dilute the comedic impact and educational value.",
      "Ensuring the 'Family Guy style' humor lands without being overly complex or alienating a general audience on Instagram is a tightrope walk."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Use a split-screen for L'H\u00f4pital's Rule, showing the dragon struggling with a '0/0' problem, then a quick cut to Master Ninja performing a 'Derivative Dash' on both numerator and denominator, resolving the issue.",
      "Allocate approximately 7-8 seconds per concept: L'H\u00f4pital's rule (0/0 and inf/inf) and Darboux/advanced limits. Each segment should feature a distinct 'ninja move' visual for the calculus technique, e.g., 'Zero-Over-Zero Slice' for L'H\u00f4pital's rule.",
      "Use quick cuts between the dragon's humorous attempts at calculus and the master's dramatic reveals of 'advanced limit techniques' as ultimate moves.",
      "Dedicate roughly 7-8 seconds to L'H\u00f4pital's Rule: visualize the '0/0' as a baby dragon trying to split an indivisible smoke ring. Master Ninja reveals the 'derivative secret' by quickly showing the differentiated numerator and denominator on a scroll, resolving the visual paradox with a satisfying 'poof' sound.",
      "For Darboux Theorem and advanced limits, use a 'stairway to infinity' visual where the dragon ascends it with increasingly exaggerated ninja leaps. Each leap represents a limit evaluation, with the final 'ultimate technique' being a perfect landing at the top, synchronized with a celestial chime.",
      "Implement distinct sound effects for each technique: a dramatic 'WHOOSH' for L'H\u00f4pital's, a mystical chime for Darboux, and a comical 'boing' for advanced limits.",
      "Map L'H\u00f4pital's Rule to a 'divide and conquer' ninja move, slicing indeterminate forms like '0/0 demons' with a 'derivative blade.'",
      "Visualize Darboux Theorem as a 'secret scroll' that, when opened, reveals a 'double derivative' technique, perhaps performed with synchronized kicks."

      "To make this Family Guy-style calculus comedy engaging on Instagram, we must translate complex math into rapid-fire visual gags mirroring ninja training, ensuring each calculus concept gets a distinct, punchy 'ultimate technique' visual.  The core challenge is balancing educational clarity with the comedic pacing needed for Instagram's fast-paced environment.",
      "To create an engaging 35-second Family Guy-style calculus comedy for Instagram, we need to prioritize rapid-fire visual gags tied to distinct ninja 'ultimate techniques' for each calculus concept. This approach ensures the humor lands, the educational points are visually reinforced, and the pacing keeps viewers hooked.",
      "To maximize engagement for our Family Guy-style calculus video on Instagram, we must synchronize each calculus concept (Darboux, L'H\u00f4pital's) with a punchy ninja visual metaphor. This ensures quick comprehension and maintains the rapid-fire comedic pacing essential for the platform and duration."
