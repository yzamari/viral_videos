The audio must be powerful and evocative, mirroring the 'kingly' control and the 'epic music of an eternal leader.' We'll layer in subtle sound design elements, like the rustling of spellbooks and the echo of a commanding voice, to enhance the visual storytelling and keep viewers hooked within the target duration.",
