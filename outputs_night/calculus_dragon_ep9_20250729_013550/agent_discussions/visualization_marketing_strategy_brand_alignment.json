Visuals should prioritize dynamic, comedic interpretations of calculus concepts, like using a dragon's erratic flight path to illustrate velocity and slopes. The key to this length is to deliver punchy educational segments within the comedy, making complex ideas digestible and shareable.",

The \"huge animated title card\" needs to be attention-grabbing and set the comedic tone immediately, with subsequent visual metaphors like dragon velocity spikes for derivatives and measuring slopes with a treasure map.  The video's viral potential hinges on making these complex ideas digestible and meme-able through relatable, albeit absurd, treasure-hunting scenarios.",
