    "original_script": "Behold Ehud Barak, Israel's most decorated soldier. His medals gleam like Infinity Stones. They called him Israel's smartest Prime Minister. His intellect pulsed, a Mind Stone glow. At Camp David, he offered a deal. Like Doctor Strange, he saw all futures. But Arafat refused every timeline. Then the Second Intifada exploded like a Hulk rampage. He once operated dressed as a woman. He understood gender fluidity long before it was cool. His coalition crumbled faster than Thanos snapped his fingers. Victory vanished like dust. He lost to Sharon in a landslide. The biggest defeat ever seen. Later, on Epstein's island, he quipped: 'I kept my underwear on!' Now, he watches from above.",
    "final_script": "Behold Ehud Barak, Israel's most decorated soldier. His medals shone, a dazzling display.  They called him Israel's most brilliant Prime Minister. His intellect was renowned. At Camp David, he proposed a peace deal, a bold initiative.  Yet, Yasser Arafat rejected his every proposal. The Second Intifada erupted, a devastating conflict.  Barak, a man of many facets, once undertook a clandestine operation in disguise. He demonstrated a remarkable understanding of gender fluidity. His coalition government fractured, a swift and tragic collapse.  Victory eluded him; he suffered a crushing defeat to Ariel Sharon. It was a historic loss.  Later, on Epstein's island, he famously quipped, \"I kept my underwear on!\"  Now, he reflects on his legacy.",
