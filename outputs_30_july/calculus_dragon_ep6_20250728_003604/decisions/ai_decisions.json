    "reasoning": "Family Guy's established visual language is cartoon. Vibrant colors are essential for making educational concepts visually engaging and fun for a general audience on Instagram, aligning with the platform's preference for creative and animated styles.

    "reasoning": "For Instagram, avoiding the bottom 20% is key. Placing the overlay in the bottom center provides good visibility while staying within the safe zone.
