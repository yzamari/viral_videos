The initial 3-second title card needs to be exceptionally high-energy, setting a tone of explosive action and comedic absurdity that immediately hooks the viewer.  Visually translating each mathematical concept into a distinct, fast-paced action sequence is paramount for maintaining attention within the tight 35-second timeframe.",

The animated title card needs to be visually arresting, setting a tone of high-energy chaos immediately. Each 'train car' sequence should be a distinct, rapid-fire visual gag that demonstrates a mathematical concept through exaggerated action, ensuring constant engagement.",
