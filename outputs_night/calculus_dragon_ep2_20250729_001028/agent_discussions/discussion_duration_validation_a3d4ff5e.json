The 3-second animated title card is crucial for immediate engagement, and we must then pack the educational content and gags efficiently to meet the 40-second target without sacrificing clarity or humor.

        "The 'bounded sequences' as safety rails should be a visually distinct 4-5 second segment, reinforcing the concept through a clear, simple graphic overlay.",
