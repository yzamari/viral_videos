# Release Notes

## v3.2.2 (July 28, 2025)

### 🎬 Major Video Generation Fixes

#### RTL Text Rendering
- **Fixed Hebrew/Arabic text reversal**: Text now displays correctly using `arabic-reshaper` and `python-bidi`
- **Proper bidirectional text support**: Hebrew subtitles no longer appear reversed (זקן instead of ןקז)
- **Automatic RTL detection**: System detects RTL languages and applies proper text shaping
- **Fallback support**: Graceful degradation if RTL libraries unavailable

#### Animation Style Recognition 
- **Fixed Ghibli style detection**: Enhanced style matching for complex style strings
- **Proper style enhancement**: "studio ghibli magical realism" now correctly applies Ghibli animation
- **Improved style mapping**: Better partial matching for animation styles

#### Audio-Subtitle Synchronization
- **Perfect timing alignment**: Replaced overlapping audio with proper silence gaps
- **Sequential audio playback**: Audio segments now play at exact subtitle timings
- **Dynamic silence insertion**: Calculates and inserts precise silence between segments
- **End-of-video padding**: Added proper silence at video end to match duration

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Added RTL text reshaping in `video_generator.py` for all subtitle rendering
- Enhanced `visual_style_agent.py` style detection algorithm
- Rewrote audio concatenation logic with proper gap calculation
- Added `fix_rtl_rendering.py` utility for RTL package installation

### 📦 New Dependencies

- Added examples and best practices for tagged content

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
