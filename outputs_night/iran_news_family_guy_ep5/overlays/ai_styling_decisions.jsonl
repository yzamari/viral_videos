Impact font is bold and commands attention. A bright orange background (REDDISH-ORANGE for urgency and excitement) with a stark white text and black stroke ensures high contrast and readability even at smaller sizes. A subtle pulse animation keeps it dynamic and encourages action. Shadow adds depth and further contrast.", "color_psychology": "The bright orange (#FF4500, a vivid Sunset Orange) taps into the 'urgency and excitement' color psychology, making viewers feel compelled to act. Combined with the high-contrast white text and black outline, it achieves the required 7:1 contrast ratio (WCAG AAA) for excellent readability. The dark red shadow reinforces the urgency and adds a premium, eye-catching feel."}}
