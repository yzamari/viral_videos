The audio strategy should focus on vocal performances that embody the Family Guy essence, with Maryam delivering her lines with a slightly deadpan yet amused tone, and the Peter Griffin-style character using a gruff, dismissive delivery. The sound design needs to be exaggerated and cartoonish for the water droplets and the overall news segment to amplify the absurdity.",
