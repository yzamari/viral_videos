[VISUAL: HUGE animated title card: 'EPISODE 13: Dragon Detective Agency!' with epic, fiery effects, fading to a cartoon dragon in a trench coat examining a complex graph.] DIALOGUE: Welcome to Dragon Detective Agency! Today, we crack the case of the crazy curve. [VISUAL: The dragon points a magnifying glass at the graph's x-axis. Text overlays show 'Domain: All Real Numbers'.] DIALOGUE: First, we check the domain, the suspects' possible hiding spots. [VISUAL: The dragon finds peaks and valleys on the graph, marking them as 'Critical Points'. An animation shows 'Derivative Test 1: Ups/Downs'.] DIALOGUE: Next, critical points reveal mood swings, using the first derivative test for direction. [VISUAL: The dragon analyzes the curve's bend, showing 'Concavity' and 'Inflection Points'. An animation shows 'Derivative Test 2: Curve Ball!'.] DIALOGUE: The second derivative test uncovers hidden curves and inflection points, the plot twists! [VISUAL: The dragon draws the complete sketched curve, highlighting asymptotes. Final shot of the dragon looking satisfied.] DIALOGUE: With all clues gathered, we sketch the curve, including asymptotes, solving the case for good!
