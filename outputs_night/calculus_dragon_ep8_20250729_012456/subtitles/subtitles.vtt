00:00.000 --> 00:03.814
Welcome to Smooth Dragon Flights, where
calculus takes flight!

00:04.114 --> 00:05.760
We do not teleport;

00:06.060 --> 00:07.653
we fly smoothly.

00:07.953 --> 00:12.237
We approach our destination with
precision, like approaching a limit.

00:12.537 --> 00:15.045
Limits must agree from all directions.

00:15.345 --> 00:18.793
Smooth flying means a successful landing
from any approach.

00:19.093 --> 00:21.679
Continuous flight means no sudden stops;

00:21.979 --> 00:23.991
our flight path is unbroken.

00:24.291 --> 00:28.340
If our flight path connects smoothly, we
always reach our destination.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.599
This is continuity in action
