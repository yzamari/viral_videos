With a dark suit shining like magical armor and eagle-sharp eyes, he controls political forces like a king. His voice echoes with his powerful staff as he makes statements that move nations. But beneath the magic, his heart still beats with love for Israel. A typhoon of controversies surrounds him, but he stands firm as a rock against the storm. Epic music of an eternal leader.",
