The Peter Griffin character's delivery of 'Water? Never heard of her.' should be accompanied by a visual cue like a shrug or a blank stare, reinforcing the humor without needing extra dialogue., Audio emphasis: Ensure Maryam's 'ghosted Iran' line is delivered with a slightly dramatic but still comedic tone.

      "suggestions": [
        "**Pacing & Visuals:** Start with a sharp, professional news intro featuring the Iran International logo. Maryam's initial report should be delivered with a slightly deadpan, yet urgent tone. Immediately transition to the animated map of Iran; the water droplets should be rendered with exaggerated, comical movements, suitcases in tow. The 'running away' animation needs to be fast and visually impactful. Peter Griffin's appearance should be a quick cut-in, his line delivered with signature oafish ignorance, followed by a brief shot of citizens desperately licking dew.",
        "**Subtitle Strategy:** Utilize the 1-2 sentence subtitle rule strictly. For example, Maryam's line: 'BREAKING NEWS: Scientists confirm water has officially ghosted Iran.' followed by 'It left no forwarding address.' This structure makes it easy to follow the dialogue even with fast cuts.",
        "**Viral Hook Amplification:** The 'ghosted' concept is strong. Amplify it with the visual of water droplets literally running away. The 'Water? Never heard of her.' line is a classic Family Guy trope that provides instant recognition and a strong reaction point. The 'Dew Licking Tutorial' lower third is a perfect, absurd punchline that begs for sharing and discussion.",
        "**Technical Considerations:** Ensure high-quality, clean professional news graphics for the overlay. The animation style for the map and water droplets should be distinctively 'Family Guy' \u2013 simplified, bold, and expressive. Audio mixing is crucial: Maryam's voice should be clear, Peter Griffin's should mimic the original character's timbre, and sound effects for the droplets should be cartoonish. Maintain the Iran International logo in the top-right corner consistently."

        "Visual Storytelling & Continuity: Ensure the 'Persian Lois Griffin' anchor design is distinct and memorable. The animated map should be cartoony and dynamic, with water droplets portrayed as distinct, fleeing characters. Peter Griffin's 'official' look should be instantly recognizable and slightly disheveled, amplifying his character's obliviousness. The citizens licking dew should be visually stark, emphasizing the desperation and absurdity.",
        "Viral Hooks & Engagement Strategy: The core joke about water ghosting Iran, coupled with the visual of fleeing water droplets and Peter Griffin's iconic 'Never heard of her,' taps into meme culture and absurdity. The 'Dew Licking Tutorial' lower third is a perfect clickbait element for YouTube, promising further comedic content and encouraging channel engagement.",
        "Technical Considerations: The professional news overlay graphics must be sharp and clean, contrasting with the animated segments. The Iran International logo should be consistently placed without overwhelming the visuals. Sound design is crucial for Family Guy's comedic timing; exclamations and character voices must mimic the show's style precisely. The news ticker must be legible at a glance."

        "The dialogue for Maryam should be delivered with a subtle, almost deadpan seriousness that contrasts with the absurdity of the situation, making the humor land harder. The Peter Griffin line needs that signature 'Family Guy' confused drawl.",
