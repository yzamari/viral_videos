Each segment should be a quick, impactful beat, visually representing the Infinity Stones, glowing brain, alternate futures, Hulk rampage, and Thanos snap with dynamic graphics and sound design.",

The key is to make each Marvel comparison a distinct visual and auditory punch, building momentum toward the darkly humorous conclusion.",

Each comparison needs a distinct sonic identity, from the sharp clicks of 'Infinity Stones' medals to the booming 'Hulk rampage' of the Second Intifada and the layered future sounds of 'Doctor Strange.' The pacing must be relentless, with clear audio transitions to ensure each analogy lands impactfully within the 65-second timeframe.",
