The core strategy must focus on a rapid, attention-grabbing hook within the first 1-2 seconds and a punchy comedic payoff to maximize watch time and completion rates, which are critical algorithm signals.",

From an engagement hacking perspective, the priority is to infuse psychological triggers like surprise and absurd humor within those critical seconds, designed to provoke an immediate, shareable emotional reaction. We need to engineer a 'WTF' or 'LOL' moment that inherently compels the viewer to share.",

Our data indicates that content triggering immediate, extreme emotional responses, particularly humor and surprise, exhibits significantly higher share rates and repeat views, which are critical for algorithmic amplification.",

For a 10-second comedy short, even minor encoding artifacts, audio synchronization issues, or buffering delays can completely derail the intended comedic impact and user retention, directly impacting watch time and shareability.",
