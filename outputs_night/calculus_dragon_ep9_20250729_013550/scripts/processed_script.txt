Welcome, treasure hunters! Today, we hunt dragon gold and learn about math. To find the most treasure, we must check the endpoints of our quest. This is the Extreme Value Theorem in action. Smooth, continuous dragon flights are essential; jerky flights are not. Our dragon must fly without sudden stops. The dragon's speed at any moment is its derivative, the instantaneous rate of change. If its path allows a tangent line, it is differentiable and continuous. Finding treasure is like following a predictable path
