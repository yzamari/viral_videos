  "mission": "Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon in ninja dojo learns secret calculus techniques. Teach Darboux theorem, L'H\u00f4pital's rule for various indeterminate forms, and advanced limit techniques. Use visual metaphors: ninja training, secret scrolls, ultimate techniques. Show how to handle 0/0, infinity/infinity, and other indeterminate forms with humor and clarity.",

Master Splinter-like ninja master gestures to a scroll.] DIALOGUE: Young Ignis, the ancient texts reveal limits beyond imagination. [VISUAL: Ignis attempts a complex kata, a fiery '0/0' symbol appears, then dissipates.] DIALOGUE: Mastering '0 divided by 0' requires the L'H\u00f4pital's swift strike. [VISUAL: Ignis breathes fire, creating an 'infinity over infinity' cloud. The master slices it cleanly.] DIALOGUE: This 'infinity over infinity' knot, we untangle with derivatives' might. [VISUAL: Ignis points a claw at a waterfall. The water flow magically reverses and then zeroes out.] DIALOGUE: The Darboux double-check, a precise vanishing act for unseen bounds. [VISUAL: Ignis performs a final, glowing ninja pose. A golden 'Calculus Dragon' aura surrounds him.] DIALOGUE: These calculus secrets, you have truly claimed, my fiery prot\u00e9g\u00e9.",
