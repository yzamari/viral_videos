      "Utilize dramatic, comic-book style sound effects (e.g., 'POW!', 'THWACK!', 'CRUNCH!') for key moments of decision or impact in Ben-Gurion's story, perfectly synced with visual cues. This will inject the superhero feel and highlight his actions.",
      "Utilize dramatic, comic-book style sound effects (e.g., 'SWOOSH!', 'CRACKLE!', 'THWACK!') for key moments and transitions, synced perfectly with on-screen action, to enhance the superhero feel.",

      "Ensure pacing allows for quick cuts and impactful sound design. Consider a swelling orchestral score that abruptly cuts out for a punchline or a dramatic pause, enhancing the dark humor.",
      "Visually represent key moments of his leadership with comic-book style graphics and fast cuts, mirroring Marvel's pacing. Allocate approximately 8-9 seconds per segment to ensure all content fits within the \u00b15% duration tolerance, allowing for visual transitions.",

      "Visually represent key moments of his leadership with comic-book style graphics and fast cuts, mirroring Marvel's pacing. For instance, a swift transition from a desert landscape to a stylized 'map reveal' of the new nation.",
      "Employ a deep, commanding voiceover with subtle sarcastic undertones, akin to a Marvel narrator, to deliver the dark humor effectively. Example: '[VISUAL: Ben-Gurion looking sternly at a document] DIALOGUE: Some heroes wear capes. He just signed paperwork. A lot of it.'",
      "Employ a deep, commanding voiceover with subtle sarcastic undertones, emulating a Marvel narrator, to deliver punchy, dark-humor dialogue like: '[VISUAL: Ben-Gurion looking determined against a stark background] DIALOGUE: They faced a void. He filled it. Mostly with paperwork.'",
      "Incorporate visual elements reminiscent of comic panels or superhero movie trailers. Think dynamic text overlays with comic-style fonts, rapid cuts between historical footage that's been color-graded to a desaturated, dramatic palette, and striking silhouette shots.",
      "Craft dialogue that directly references Ben-Gurion's core actions with a 'superhero' framing, such as 'He didn't wear a cape, but he built a nation. And then complained about the commute.'",
      "Craft dialogue that directly references Ben-Gurion's core actions with a 'superhero' framing, such as 'He didn't wear a cape, but he built a nation' for dark humor, keeping each sentence under 15 words for readability."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To make this concept engaging for Instagram, we'll lean heavily into rapid, comic-book-style visual montages combined with a dry, almost reluctant superhero narrator. The dark humor will stem from juxtaposing Ben-Gurion's immense historical impact with a modern, slightly jaded superhero trope.",
      "For a 35-second Instagram intro of Ben-Gurion as a Marvel-style hero with dark humor, we must prioritize dynamic visual storytelling. This means rapid cuts between historical footage treated with comic-book effects (think 'POW!' text overlays, bold outlines, and desaturated comic palette) and modern stylized graphics. The voiceover should be our primary driver of the dark humor, delivering lines with a deep, slightly weary gravitas, as if he's the reluctant hero of a world he barely understands.",
      "To best introduce David Ben-Gurion in a Marvel superhero style with dark humor for Instagram, we must prioritize audio-visual synchronization that amplifies his unwavering resolve as a 'superpower' against impossible odds, using dramatic sound effects and a narrator with subtly sarcastic undertones to deliver the humor."

    "Instagram thrives on immediate engagement, making impactful visuals and a strong narrative voice crucial for this 35-second format.
