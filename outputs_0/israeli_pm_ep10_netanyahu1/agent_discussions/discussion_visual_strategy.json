    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate specific durations for each panel as per the 'Duration & Timing Validation' consensus, ensuring each segment's visual and audio elements are optimized for maximum impact within its allocated time. For instance, the MIT graduation panel needs strong visual cues of achievement and clear English speech, while the 'HULK SARA SMASH!' moment demands aggressive visual and auditory cues., Emphasize quick, dynamic transitions between panels, mirroring comic book page turns or splash pages, and utilize strong, thematic sound design (e.g., heroic fanfare for victories, chaotic soundscapes for the tunnel opening, sharp stingers for scandals) to enhance emotional resonance and convey information efficiently., Allocate specific durations to each 'panel' based on the consensus points, ensuring seamless transitions and maintaining the 65-second target. For instance, MIT graduation panel (6-8s), Election panel (7-8s), Western Wall tunnel (8-10s), Scandal montage (7-9s), Coalition collapse (6-8s), Landslide loss (5-7s), Mirror practice (4-6s), Post-credit tease (1-2s).",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Ensuring the visual composition in each panel is strong enough to convey the narrative without excessive detail that could push segments over their allocated time.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the sheer volume of narrative points requested within the 65-second limit. Each panel needs to be impactful without feeling rushed, which requires extremely efficient visual storytelling and dialogue delivery, adhering strictly to the 1-2 sentence rule per segment.",
      "Maintaining audio clarity and impact across rapid scene changes within the 65-second limit, especially ensuring the 'dissolves like Spider-Man' effect is aurally distinct, is a significant challenge.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring that the rapid pacing and diverse visual elements do not lead to visual clutter or a disjointed narrative. Each transition must be sharp and purposeful to maintain momentum without overwhelming the viewer, and the tight scripting (1-2 sentences per segment) is crucial for clarity."

      "Employ a distinct visual style for each major plot point: bright, aspirational for MIT; intense, focused for elections; chaotic, unsettling for the tunnel; rapid-cut, indulgent for scandals; fragmented, dramatic for collapse; defeated yet determined for loss; reflective for practice. This visual differentiation will enhance clarity and impact within the short timeframe.",

      "Allocate precise audio-visual sync for each key moment: 'MR. SECURITY' glowing with a subtle power-up sound, the 'WHOOSH' of spirits escaping, and a sharp 'HULK SARA SMASH!' sound effect with a visual impact."
