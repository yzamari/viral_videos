The initial 'rise' phase will be dynamic, using fast cuts of 'WANTED' posters and the thought bubble to establish defiance. The 'Camp David' and 'Peace Signing' scenes will be elevated with cinematic framing and symbolic imagery, emphasizing hope. A sharp sonic and visual shift will then plunge into the 'Lebanon War Chaos' and 'Depression Spiral,' utilizing distorted effects and a breakdown sequence to convey the catastrophic fall. The 'Cave Hermit' and caption will be delivered with somber gravitas, and the post-credit map will build a creeping sense of dread.",
