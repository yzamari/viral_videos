For the \"HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD,\" incorporate bold typography with dynamic warping, particle effects, and a powerful sound design that transitions into an energetic orchestral score.  During battles, use \"Marvel-style action effects\" like impactful impact frames, dynamic camera zooms, and bright, stylized energy blasts for dragon fire, synchronized with the number monster's attacks (e.g., ice shards for negative integers, pizza projectiles for rationals).",
        "**Technical Approach:** The core technical approach is extreme efficiency. Allocate the first 3 seconds strictly for the title card. Then, segment the remaining 30-32 seconds into ~7-8 second bursts per number set. Each burst needs a quick visual introduction of the monster, a rapid combat exchange highlighting a key property, and Epsilon's witty educational comment.  For example, Natural Numbers (cookie zombies): [VISUAL: Zombie Epsilon-style chomping cookies] DIALOGUE: 'These natural numbers just want a bite!' followed by Epsilon dodging a cookie attack. The audio should be layered with \"explosive\" sound effects, dragon roars, and comedic vocalizations.

Focusing on short, shareable \"combat\" clips demonstrating each number property could be particularly effective.",
