Distinguished faculty, esteemed guests, and fellow graduates. Today marks a momentous occasion. My name is Bibi Netanyahu. I hail from Israel. And I am ready to lead. Mr. Security glows with an inner power. Behold, the chest beam of influence! Narrow victory! Just one percent separates me from my opponent. The people have spoken. The Western Wall tunnel opening unleashes a portal. Chaos and spirits escape, dissolving peace. Cigars and champagne flow. Sara enters RAGE MODE. Hulk Sara smash these political foes! The coalition has collapsed. My heroic allies have scattered. Disbanding the ranks now. I will be back. I will practice in mirrors. One day, I will be the longest serving leader.
