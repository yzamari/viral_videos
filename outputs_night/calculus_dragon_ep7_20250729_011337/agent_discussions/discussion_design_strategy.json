    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Design the title card animation to incorporate quick, impactful transformations of the baby dragon, perhaps morphing into different shapes that subtly hint at mathematical concepts, all within the 3-second window., Visually represent 'domain' and 'range' as distinct 'territories' or transformation 'settings' the dragon can operate within, using clear visual cues for inputs and outputs, and for one-to-one and onto functions, show the dragon transforming uniquely or mapping perfectly to its targets., Ensure the 'Function Dragon Transform' title card uses a heavy, impactful sans-serif font with energetic animation, possibly incorporating glowing effects or quick cuts that mimic Family Guy's style. This immediately hooks the viewer.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting all the requested function concepts (domain, range, one-to-one, onto, bijections, composition, even/odd, periodic) into a mere 37 seconds of explanatory content while maintaining the comedic tone and visual clarity. Each concept needs a carefully crafted, instantly understandable visual metaphor.",
      "The primary concern is cramming all the listed function types into a 40-second video without sacrificing clarity. Each concept needs enough visual explanation, making tight scripting and animation essential to avoid overwhelming the audience.",
      "The primary concern is fitting the explanation of all the listed functions (transformation rules, domain, range, one-to-one, onto, bijections, composition, even/odd, periodic) into just 37 seconds after the title card, while maintaining clarity and the Family Guy comedic style. Over-simplification might occur, potentially sacrificing educational depth for brevity.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the required function concepts (domain, range, one-to-one, onto, bijections, composition, even/odd, periodic) into a 40-second video while maintaining the comedic Family Guy style and clarity. Each concept needs to be extremely concise and visually intuitive."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Dedicate brief, visually distinct segments (3-5 seconds each) to each function concept. For instance, domain and range can be shown as the dragon morphing into different shapes, with visible boundaries of what it can and cannot become, using a 'transformation machine' visual.",
      "Craft the 'Function Dragon Transform' title card with explosive motion graphics, perhaps involving the dragon bursting out of the text, using vibrant colors that pop on Instagram's feed. Immediately after, use quick cuts and energetic character animation for the baby dragon to introduce each function concept with a distinct visual metaphor, like transforming into different shapes to illustrate domain/range or using mirrored movements for even/odd functions.",
      "Design the title card animation to incorporate quick, impactful transformations of the baby dragon, perhaps morphing into different shapes that subtly hint at mathematical concepts, all within the 3-second window.",
      "For the title card, animate the words 'Function Dragon Transform!!' to explode into existence with a powerful, impactful sound effect and a color palette of electric blues, fiery reds, and metallic golds, followed by a quick, close-up shot of the baby dragon winking.",
      "For domain and range, use the 'Dragon Transformation Machine' visual. The machine's input slot represents the domain, and the output forms represent the range. The dragon's various forms illustrate these sets clearly.  The territory map metaphor works well for domain and range, showing the dragon's possible shapes within specific boundaries.",
      "Visually represent 'domain' and 'range' as distinct 'territories' or transformation 'settings' the dragon can operate within, using clear visual cues for inputs and outputs, and for one-to-one and onto functions, show the dragon transforming uniquely or mapping perfectly to its targets.",
      "Ensure the 'Function Dragon Transform' title card uses a heavy, impactful sans-serif font with energetic animation, possibly incorporating glowing effects or quick cuts that mimic Family Guy's style. This immediately hooks the viewer.",
      "Ensure the pacing is incredibly brisk; each function explanation should be under 5 seconds, driven by the dragon's visual gags and transformations. For example, composition could be shown by the dragon transforming into a smaller version of itself, which then transforms again. Use on-screen text overlays that are large and animated to reinforce key terms like 'Domain,' 'Range,' 'Bijection,' etc., synchronized with the visual gags."

    "consensus_points": [
      "For Episode 7, the key is to balance the Family Guy-esque humor with clear, visually driven explanations of complex functions. The animated title card needs to be attention-grabbing, setting a playful yet educational tone immediately. Leveraging the dragon's transformations to illustrate function concepts like domain, range, and composition will be crucial for engagement on Instagram within the 40-second timeframe.",
      "For Episode 7, a dynamic, character-driven approach is paramount. The \"Dragon Transform\" title card must be visually arresting, using bold, legible typography that screams 'epic fun'.  Each function concept should be anchored by a clear, concise visual metaphor, making the dragon's transformations directly relatable to domain, range, and composition.",
      "For Episode 7, the animated title card needs to immediately evoke the Family Guy humor with a dynamic, explosive reveal of 'Function Dragon Transform!' using bold, vibrant colors like fiery oranges and deep purples to convey epic transformation. The subsequent 37 seconds must be a rapid-fire, visually rich explanation of function concepts, using the dragon's transformations as direct, engaging metaphors, ensuring each concept is presented with a distinct, memorable visual style."
