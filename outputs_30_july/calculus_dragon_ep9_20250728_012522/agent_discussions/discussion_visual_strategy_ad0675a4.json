        "Represent derivatives as the dragon's flight path: show its speedometer fluctuating wildly on a jagged, treacherous mountain ascent (high positive derivative) versus a slow glide over a flat, boring field (near zero derivative). A steep downhill plummet towards a treasure could be a sharp negative derivative.",
        "To demonstrate continuity and differentiability, show the dragon attempting to fly a perfectly smooth, continuous path to a treasure, but encountering a sudden chasm (discontinuity).
