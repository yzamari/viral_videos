This just in: Tehran has gone full Mad Max. Peter Griffin-style warriors fight for the last water bottle. Witness me! This precious water is mine now. This reminds me of my novel about drought. Oh dear, I have been hit by a water truck. There is no water to wash my hijab anyway. It is a chicken fight out there with dehydration. Iran International: We are as thirsty as you are! Water apocalypse.
