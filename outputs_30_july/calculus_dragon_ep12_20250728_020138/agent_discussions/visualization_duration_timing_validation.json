We need a high density of recognizable Family Guy-esque humor, with the dragon acting as a flamboyant, slightly incompetent teacher, using crystal ball predictions for approximations and shrinking error 'magic' for convergence.",

Each concept should be condensed into a quick, punchy visual metaphor that visually demonstrates increasing precision and shrinking errors, mirroring the dragon's fortune-telling predictions. The proof of e's irrationality needs a similarly absurd, yet clear, visual explanation within the short timeframe.",

Each segment must be tightly paced to cover the required concepts within the target duration, ensuring the visual metaphors are both comedic and demonstrative.",
