1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,919
Sparky's rocket pack is a sequence;

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,560
will it

3
00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:04,231
reach the stars or fizzle?

4
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:05,054
We test its

5
00:00:05,354 --> 00:00:06,738
divergence with rocket launches.

6
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:08,123
Even shrinking spells cannot

7
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:10,042
stop its epic ascent.

8
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:11,662
Nth roots approaching one

9
00:00:11,962 --> 00:00:17,317
mirror Sparky's planetary aim, a slow but
sure

10
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:18,313
approach.

11
00:00:18,313 --> 00:00:23,181
For growing plants, the ratio test shows

12
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,247
rapid growth, similar to Sparky's rocket
engine.

13
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:26,642
The

14
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:28,931
root test also reveals amazing growth
rates.

15
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:29,215
Sparky's

16
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:30,562
rocket found infinity.

17
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:33,355
Sequences either converge or diverge with
rocket-fueled speed
