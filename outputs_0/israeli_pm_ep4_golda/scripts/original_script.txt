SMOKE PANEL! Golda emerges, cigarette glowing with raw power. She speaks, her voice a gravelly command. “I am the only man in the cabinet!” TRANSFORMATION! Cabinet members gasp, shrinking down to mere toddlers. Their important debates are now childish cries. Action panels explode! Yom Kippur War! Coffee pot in one hand, tank radio in the other. KABOOM! SNAP! Intelligence failure panel! Crucial files scatter like fallen leaves. Warnings were ignored, lost to the wind. TIME REWIND PANELS flash, showing those ignored warnings. Kitchen diplomacy now begins. World leaders shrink in her formidable presence. Resignation panel. A mushroom cloud of smoke billows. The final panel arrives, the internet ignites. “There is no Palestine!” POW! The world explodes in a digital firestorm.
