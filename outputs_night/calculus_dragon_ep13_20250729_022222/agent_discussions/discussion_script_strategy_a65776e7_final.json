    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate the first 3 seconds to the 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD' with dramatic, comedic sound effects. Immediately follow with the dragon detective character introducing the 'case' of a function, perhaps with a classic Family Guy-esque sigh., Visually represent each step of function analysis as a 'clue' or 'piece of evidence' in the dragon's investigation. For example, finding the domain could be the dragon examining the 'boundaries' of the crime scene (the function's graph)., For concavity, show the dragon's mood explicitly changing (e.g., happy for concave up, grumpy for concave down) as the graph's shape shifts, directly linking the 'mood swings' metaphor to the mathematical concept.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Ensuring the Family Guy-esque humor lands effectively and doesn't overshadow the educational aspect is crucial; the humor needs to *serve* the learning, not detract from it.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the systematic function analysis steps (domain, critical points, first/second derivative tests, inflection points, asymptotes, sketching) clearly and humorously into the remaining 37 seconds without feeling rushed, which requires exceptionally tight scripting and precise visual timing.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring all systematic function analysis steps are covered clearly and concisely within the remaining ~37 seconds after the title card, demanding extremely efficient visual execution and minimal dialogue per segment.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring all analytical steps are covered clearly and concisely within the tight timeframe, without the visuals or dialogue becoming too rushed to be understood, especially for a general audience. Precise timing is paramount."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Integrate rapid-fire 'case file' graphics for each analytical step (domain, critical points, etc.), featuring the dragon detective examining clues related to the function, to visually anchor the educational content.",
      "Utilize quick cuts and text overlays for each derivative test (first for increasing/decreasing, second for concavity) as 'interrogations' of the function's behavior.",
      "End with a brief, satisfying 'case closed' visual of the sketched function, with the dragon giving a thumbs-up or a witty sign-off.",
      "Allocate 1-2 seconds per mathematical concept (domain, critical points, derivatives, inflection points, asymptotes) using quick 'case file' graphics for the dragon detective, each with a punchy, funny line of dialogue and a corresponding visual representation of the math.",
      "Allocate the first 3 seconds to the 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD' with dramatic, comedic sound effects. Immediately follow with the dragon detective character introducing the 'case' of a function, perhaps with a classic Family Guy-esque sigh.",
      "Ensure the 'mood swings' for concavity are exaggerated and directly tied to the dragon's facial expressions and animation, using distinct sound effects for each mood shift to reinforce the concept's comedic and educational value.",
      "Visually represent each step of function analysis as a 'clue' or 'piece of evidence' in the dragon's investigation. For example, finding the domain could be the dragon examining the 'boundaries' of the crime scene (the function's graph).",
      "For concavity, show the dragon's mood explicitly changing (e.g., happy for concave up, grumpy for concave down) as the graph's shape shifts, directly linking the 'mood swings' metaphor to the mathematical concept.",
      "Animate the 'mood swings' for concavity with exaggerated facial expressions from the dragon, directly correlating with the graph's curvature, making the abstract concept tangible and humorous."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To make 'EPISODE 13: Dragon Detective Agency!!' highly engaging on Instagram within 40 seconds, we need to leverage the initial epic animated title card for immediate hook and then rapidly translate the complex function analysis steps into visually distinct, comedic 'case files' for our dragon detective. The 'mood swings' for concavity must be explicitly animated to directly correlate with the dragon's expressions and the function's shape, ensuring the educational content is both memorable and entertaining.",
      "To maximize engagement for \"EPISODE 13: Dragon Detective Agency!!\" on Instagram, we must leverage rapid visual storytelling. The 3-second animated title card needs to be punchy and comedic, immediately establishing the Family Guy tone. The subsequent function analysis should be broken down into micro-segments, visually linking each mathematical step to the dragon detective's investigation and \"mood swings\" for concavity, ensuring clarity and humor within the tight timeframe.",
      "For maximum Instagram engagement with 'EPISODE 13: Dragon Detective Agency!!', we must prioritize rapid, visually-driven learning. The initial 3-second animated title card needs truly epic sound design to hook viewers, immediately followed by bite-sized, comedic explanations of each function analysis step, directly linking them to the detective and 'mood swing' metaphors."
