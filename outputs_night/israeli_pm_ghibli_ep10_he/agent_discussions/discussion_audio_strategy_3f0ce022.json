For example, dedicating the initial seconds to the 'high-tech flowers blooming from ancient desert sand' and Peres's posture, then transitioning to the 'colorful birds carrying startup ideas' with a subtle sound effect., Emphasize sonic details for the 'Studio Ghibli magic': use ethereal chimes for blooming flowers, soft fluttering for birds, and a gentle, warm glow for the 'bridges of light.' The Dimona reactor's sound should be a low, hum of peaceful energy, not industrial. The 'origami cranes' transformation can have a crisp, paper-folding sound. The final 'robots dancing the hora' should have a playful, upbeat synthesized tune blending with traditional instrumentation., For dialogue, keep each sentence short (around 10-15 words) and delivered with a calm, inspiring tone, mimicking Peres's wisdom. Each spoken segment should ideally be no more than two sentences to ensure subtitles are easily readable and sync perfectly with visual changes.

        "For the 'high-tech flowers blooming from ancient desert sand' and 'colorful birds carrying startup ideas,' I recommend a layered soundscape: gentle, ethereal chimes for the blooming flowers, subtly growing in intensity, accompanied by a delicate, almost shimmering flutter for the birds. This establishes the magical Ghibli tone immediately. The 'startup ideas' could be represented by a subtle, positive 'sparkle' sound effect as they fly by.",
        "The 'bridges of light' need a warm, almost humming synth pad, creating a sense of gentle connection. For the Dimona reactor, a low, resonant hum of peaceful, contained energy is crucial \u2013 avoid any harsh or industrial tones. The 'whispers to the wind' should be extremely subtle, almost subliminal vocalizations blended with a gentle breeze effect. For the 'origami cranes,' a crisp, satisfying paper-folding sound should synchronize perfectly with their transformation, and the 'robots dancing the hora' requires a playful, synthesized melody mixed with a light, rhythmic percussive element that hints at traditional Israeli music."
