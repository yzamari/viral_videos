  "mission_statement": "Create a Family Guy style comedy where dragon detective investigates functions completely. Teach systematic function analysis: finding domain, critical points, using first and second derivative tests, finding inflection points, asymptotes, and sketching curves. Use visual metaphors: detective investigation, solving cases, mood swings for concavity. Make the complete function investigation process entertaining and memorable.",

  "target_outcome": "Achieve a 10% engagement rate (likes, comments, shares) on the Instagram post and a 5% increase in website traffic (if applicable) within 24 hours of posting, demonstrating audience understanding of at least one function analysis technique (e.g., finding the domain).",
  "strategic_approach": "Humorous, fast-paced visual storytelling using the Family Guy style to introduce function analysis concepts through a dragon detective solving a 'case' (a function).",
