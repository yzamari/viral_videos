The \"PEACE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!\" needs an uplifting swell, contrasted by chaotic \"CLANG! BANG!\" effects for the dissent, leading into a stark, impactful \"ASSASSINATION NOIR\" sequence with distinct gunshot sounds and a resonant silence for maximum emotional impact.",

The audio should build from hopeful anticipation ('PEACE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!') to chaotic dissent ('TRAITOR!' with symbiote-like spread) and culminate in the stark, dramatic 'ASSASSINATION NOIR' sequence, using distinct 'BANG!' sounds followed by a weighty silence.  The narration should be delivered with a serious, almost somber tone, emphasizing the historical weight while maintaining a brisk pace to fit the time.",

          "message": "To create a compelling 65-second Instagram video about the 'Marvel Comics return: ICE THAW PANEL!' narrative, we must synchronize the audio to amplify the dramatic shifts. This involves using distinct sound effects for each key moment: a subtle build for 'PEACE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!', jarring industrial sounds and escalating chants for the 'TRAITOR!' segment, and sharp, impactful 'BANG!'s for the assassination, followed by a profound silence. The voiceover should convey the emotional weight without slowing the pace.",
