Each segment should be a quick hit, mirroring the Marvel style, with dynamic sound design amplifying the comparisons to Infinity Stones, Mind Stone, Doctor Strange, Hulk, and Thanos. The 'gender fluidity' line needs careful vocal delivery to land with its intended irony and shock value within the fast pace.",
