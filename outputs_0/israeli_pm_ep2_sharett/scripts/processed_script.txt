Moshe Sharett appears, a sudden presence in the room. Did anyone notice his arrival?  With great responsibility comes the weight of history, a burden often unseen. Strange's hands move deftly, shaping international treaties.  Ben-Gurion's imposing shadow looms large on the screen, a constant reminder of his enduring power. He remains in office. Is it 1955 already? The air crackles with unspoken tensions. Who is the Prime Minister now? The question hangs heavy, unanswered.  A sense of uncertainty pervades the room, thick and suffocating. The weight of decisions rests heavily on their shoulders. The future of the nation hangs in the balance.  Each move is fraught with consequence.  The clock ticks relentlessly, marking the passage of time and the urgency of the moment.  A silent prayer escapes Sharett's lips, a plea for wisdom and strength. The fate of many rests on the decisions made tonight. The weight of the world presses down.  History watches, silent and judging. The future remains uncertain.
