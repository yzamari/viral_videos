    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Visually represent 'juggling multiple corruption trials while texting' as a rapid, almost absurd montage of phone screens and abstract 'trial' icons. This can be done with quick cuts and subtle visual cues, possibly accompanied by a frenetic 'typing' sound effect., For 'Coalition deals with exploding panels,' utilize a comic-style 'panel wipe' transition where the previous panel explodes to reveal the next, showcasing a different coalition deal with a 'BOOM!' sound., Utilize quick, comic-style transitions like 'POW!' or 'BAM!' wipes between each event to reinforce the Marvel aesthetic and cover scene changes efficiently.",

      "The sheer number of distinct actions described in the topic, if not timed precisely, could easily lead to exceeding the maximum duration or feeling rushed and losing impact.

      "The primary concern is ensuring each distinct action is visually clear and understandable within its brief runtime on Instagram; complex visual gags need to be instantly recognizable to avoid confusion and maintain the rapid pace."

      "For this 'Marvel Comics explosion!' topic on Instagram, the key is to lean into the hyper-kinetic, exaggerated comic book style.
