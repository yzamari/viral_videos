This allows for a more controlled and powerful audio delivery within the tight 64-second frame, ensuring each word of 'moving nations' statements lands with authority. The narration can bridge the visual segments, while short, impactful audio clips of Netanyahu's likeness (if obtainable and stylistically appropriate via AI) can be used sparingly for key phrases, layered with the echo effect.",

These subtle cues, combined with the soaring epic music, will guide the viewer through the narrative, building anticipation and reinforcing the 'political magician' metaphor.
