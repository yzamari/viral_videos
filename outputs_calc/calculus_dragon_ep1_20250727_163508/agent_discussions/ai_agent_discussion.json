The subject matter (talking numbers, dragons, magical land) is inherently fantastical and lends itself well to a cartoon aesthetic. Vibrant colors will appeal to a general audience on Instagram and make the abstract concepts of number sets visually engaging and memorable. The 'Family Guy' reference also implies a certain irreverent humor and simplified, expressive character design, which is best achieved with cartoon.",
