    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Employ a visual style that mimics classic comic book panels with dynamic transitions and exaggerated lightning/explosion effects for each action snippet, ensuring each 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!' is visually anchored., Allocate approximately 2-3 seconds per key action/dialogue snippet (e.g., 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!') to ensure all elements are covered within the 35-second window, with minimal buffer, and prioritize bold, comic-style sound effects that align with the visual punches., Implement bold, graphic overlays and comic book-style text bubbles for the 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!' sound effects, synchronizing them perfectly with the visual action.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting all the described rapid-fire actions and dialogue snippets into the strict 35-second timeframe without sacrificing the visual clarity or the punch of the sound design. Each moment needs to be extremely concise yet impactful.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring all distinct narrative beats (Knesset crash, vanishing opposition, exploding panels, juggling trials, settlements, judicial reform, repeated return) are visually represented and impactfully delivered within the tight 35-second timeframe without feeling rushed or losing clarity.",
      "The primary technical concern is rendering the intricate, rapid-fire visual effects (lightning, explosions, vanishing characters, energy beams) and synchronizing them perfectly with distinct sound cues within the tight 35-second duration, which may strain current VEO-2 capabilities for realism and speed simultaneously."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Visually represent each 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!' with distinct, impactful comic-style animation and sound design.  Ensure the lightning effects for Netanyahu and the flag are particularly striking.",
      "Implement bold, graphic overlays and comic book-style text bubbles for the 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!' sound effects, synchronizing them perfectly with the visual action.",
      "Allocate approximately 2-3 seconds per key action/dialogue snippet (e.g., 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!') to ensure all elements are covered within the 35-second window, with minimal buffer, and prioritize bold, comic-style sound effects that align with the visual punches.",
      "Time the 'juggling corruption trials while texting' segment with rapid-fire visual cuts and a subtle, quirky sound effect, perhaps a quick 'ding' for each text, to convey the multi-tasking chaos visually and audibly.",
      "Utilize quick cuts and dynamic camera movements, mirroring comic book panel transitions, to transition between each of the described events (Knesset crash, vanishing parties, exploding panels, texting, energy beams, judicial reform split, flag) to maintain a relentless pace.",
      "Employ a visual style that mimics classic comic book panels with dynamic transitions and exaggerated lightning/explosion effects for each action snippet, ensuring each 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!' is visually anchored."

      "To maximize engagement for this 'Marvel Comics explosion!' theme on Instagram within 35 seconds, we need a rapid-fire visual approach. Each described action \u2013 from the Knesset crash with lightning to juggling trials and the final flag display \u2013 must be rendered as a distinct, punchy visual 'panel' synchronized with its accompanying sound effect for maximum impact.",
      "To maximize engagement for this 'Marvel Comics explosion!' concept on Instagram, we need an aggressive, fast-paced visual and audio design.
