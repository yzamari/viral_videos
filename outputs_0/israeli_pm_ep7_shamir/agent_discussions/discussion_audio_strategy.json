    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Implement a rapid-fire montage of distinct visual styles for each panel, from the 'Winter Soldier' flashbacks to the 'Stones vs Tanks' grit, each paired with an iconic, sharp sound effect like 'SWAP!' or 'CLANG!' to punctuate the action and sync perfectly with brief, impactful voiceovers., For the 'musical chairs' sequence, use a sped-up visual with sharp cuts depicting the throne switching, accompanied by a frantic jingle that abruptly stops with a 'SWAP!' sound effect to highlight the political instability and rapid shifts in power., Allocate approximately 7-8 seconds per 'panel' segment to allow for visual setup, action, and a brief dialogue/sound cue, ensuring 8 segments fit within the 65-second target. Each visual should be dynamic and immediately recognizable, reinforcing the Marvel comic aesthetic.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The sheer density of narrative points (8 distinct segments) within 65 seconds is the primary concern, risking a rushed or overwhelming experience if not meticulously timed. We must ensure each panel's visual and audio elements are instantly understandable to avoid audience confusion or disengagement.",
      "The primary concern is fitting the sheer density of the narrative elements into a short timeframe. Each segment must be visually striking and convey its point with extreme brevity to avoid overwhelming the audience or exceeding the time limit. Coordinating the rapid-fire visual and audio cues across these distinct narrative beats will be critical for overall coherence and impact.",
      "The primary concern is the sheer density of narrative points within the 65-second timeframe. Each of the 8 described segments needs to be visually distinct and convey its core message instantaneously, requiring extremely precise editing and potentially sacrificing some visual detail for clarity and pacing."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Allocate 7 seconds for the 'Shamir ant-sized' intro, 8 seconds for 'Flashbacks' with gritty visuals and percussive music, 7 seconds for the 'Musical Chairs' with rapid cuts and a 'SWAP!' sound, 8 seconds for 'Intifada Panels' with 'CLANG!' sound, 8 seconds for the 'Madrid Conference' with a sense of reluctance, 7 seconds for the 'Bush Sr. Threat' with an ominous tone, 8 seconds for the 'Immovable vs. Unstoppable' collision with a 'CRASH!', and 10 seconds for the 'Defeat & Final' panel with the mic drop and 'BOOM!' to hit the 65-second mark precisely.",

      "For the 'musical chairs' sequence, use a sped-up visual with sharp cuts depicting the throne switching, accompanied by a frantic jingle that abruptly stops with a 'SWAP!' sound effect to highlight the political instability and rapid shifts in power.",
      "Ensure voiceovers for key lines like 'Size matters NOT!' are energetic and defiant, while Bush Sr.'s 'Your loans... GONE!' is menacing. The final 'Terror? I INVENTED it!' needs a strong, conclusive delivery, amplified by a clear mic drop sound effect and a final 'BOOM!' for maximum impact.",
      "Utilize distinct, high-impact sound effects for each panel transition (e.g., 'SWAP!', 'CLANG!', 'CRASH!', 'BOOM!') to punctuate scene changes and enhance the comic book feel, directly mirroring the 'post-production expert' focus on polish and final assembly.",
