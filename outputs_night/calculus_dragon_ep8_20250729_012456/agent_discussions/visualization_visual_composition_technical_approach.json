The core challenge is to present a dense curriculum (epsilon-delta, continuity, IVT) within 37 seconds, post-title card, with the Family Guy style comedy driving comprehension.",

The rapid-fire analogies for each math concept, framed by Family Guy-style character interactions and exaggerated flight mishaps, are key to holding attention. This approach leverages the platform's preference for quick, entertaining, and visually dynamic content.",
