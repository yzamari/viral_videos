    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For the Marvel intro, utilize aggressive camera movements and sound effects for approximately 4 seconds to establish the 'hero' persona, immediately cutting to a soft, warm Ghibli-esque transition with floating papayas and a gentle voice for Grandma (6-7 seconds). The 'reality check' needs a sharp visual and auditory cut (3 seconds), leading into an energetic 10-second party scene with distinct audio for the drunk guy's comedic line.  Conclude with a 2-3 second impactful Hebrew slogan and business info., Ensure the visual composition for the Ghibli section emphasizes vibrant, saturated colors and soft, flowing animation to contrast sharply with the gritty Marvel style.  The 'reality check' cut should be quick and almost jarring, using a mundane, slightly desaturated look to highlight the transformation.  For the night scene, focus on dynamic lighting and a bustling atmosphere that feels authentic to a popular bar scene., Implement rapid cuts and dynamic camera movements for the Marvel hero entrance and the Ghibli transformation to create visual excitement. Focus on bright, saturated colors for the Ghibli sequence to pop on screen.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is ensuring the audio transitions between the distinct visual styles (Marvel, Ghibli, reality, party) are seamless and impactful enough to maintain the comedic flow without feeling jarring. Balancing the energy levels for each segment within 32 seconds is critical for engagement.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all these stylistic shifts and narrative beats into 32 seconds without feeling rushed or confusing. Each segment must be punchy and serve the overall comedic arc.",

    "recommended_actions": [
      "The drunk guy's line needs precise comedic timing and clear delivery, even with a slight slur, to land the joke effectively. A quick, memorable Hebrew slogan with a strong call to action for the bar's details is essential for the outro.",
      "For the Marvel-style entrance, use a powerful, booming sound effect combined with a 'whoosh' as the wall breaks. The Ghibli transformation needs whimsical chimes and a warm, gentle score. The reality cut should be abrupt with a 'record scratch' or deflating sound. The night scene requires an upbeat, catchy electronic track. Crucially, the drunk guy's line needs a slightly distorted or echoey effect to enhance the humor, and the final Hebrew slogan should have a confident, anthemic delivery.",

The 'reality check' cut should be quick and almost jarring, using a mundane, slightly desaturated look to highlight the transformation.  For the night scene, focus on dynamic lighting and a bustling atmosphere that feels authentic to a popular bar scene.",
      "Implement a distinct audio signature for each visual style change. For example, the transition from Marvel to Ghibli could be a quick swell of magical sound. The cut to reality should be a sharp sound design change, perhaps a quick, comical sting. The party scene needs high-energy, modern music that drops slightly for the drunk guy's line, then swells again for the slogan. Ensure the business information at the end is clear and easy to read/hear, possibly with a subtle, memorable sound tag.",
