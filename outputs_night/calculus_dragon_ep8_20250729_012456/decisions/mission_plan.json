  "mission_statement": "EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!! Show this as HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects! Create a Family Guy style comedy where dragon pilot teaches function limits and continuity. Cover epsilon-delta definition, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity conditions, types of discontinuities, and the intermediate value theorem. Use visual metaphors: smooth flying vs teleporting, landing from different directions, altitude changes. Make limits and continuity intuitive through flight analogies.",
