Teach systematic function analysis: finding domain, critical points, using first and second derivative tests, finding inflection points, asymptotes, and sketching curves. Use visual metaphors: detective investigation, solving cases, mood swings for concavity. Make the complete function investigation process entertaining and memorable.",
