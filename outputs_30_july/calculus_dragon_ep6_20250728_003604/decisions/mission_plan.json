  "mission_statement": "Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon in power-up workshop teaches rational and real exponents, then explores topology. Cover fractional powers, real exponents as limits, accumulation points, isolated points, open and closed sets, interior and closure, and the Cantor set. Use visual metaphors: power transformations, dragon gatherings, bubble zones, fractal magic. Make topology concepts accessible and fun.",

  "target_outcome": "Achieve a 15% engagement rate (likes, comments, shares) on the Instagram post and a 5% increase in followers within 24 hours of posting, demonstrating audience comprehension of at least one core topology concept (e.g., open/closed sets) based on post comments.",
