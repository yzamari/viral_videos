The strategy emphasizes short, impactful visual sequences (6-8 seconds each for major actions) interspersed with quicker montage elements (3-5 seconds), all driven by iconic sound effects and minimal, powerful dialogue snippets for maximum engagement and adherence to the timeline.",

This approach leverages the platform's preference for fast-paced, visually stimulating content, using rapid cuts and dynamic comic art to convey the epic scope of Ben-Gurion's story and its impactful conclusion. The strategy focuses on eliciting awe and surprise through impactful audio-visual pairings, making the historical narrative as engaging as a superhero origin story.",
