The Family Guy style humor, combined with the 'power-up workshop' setting, provides a strong comedic foundation. Visual metaphors like 'fractal magic' and 'bubble zones' are key for making abstract topology concepts digestible and shareable, driving reach and interaction.",

The Family Guy style should inform character interactions and punchlines, while the power-up workshop setting allows for dynamic visual metaphors for exponents and topology.
