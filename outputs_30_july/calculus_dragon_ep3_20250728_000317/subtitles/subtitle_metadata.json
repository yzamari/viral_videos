Nth roots approaching one mirror Sparky's planetary aim, a slow but sure approach. For growing plants, the ratio test shows rapid growth, similar to Sparky's rocket engine. The root test also reveals amazing growth rates. Sparky's rocket found infinity. Sequences either converge or diverge with rocket-fueled speed",
