    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For the 'Surprise PM Panel,' use a sharp 'POW!' or 'WHOA!' sound effect synchronized with Olmert's stressed delivery of 'I didn't ASK for this!', immediately followed by a subtle, high-pitched 'spider-bite' sting for dramatic flair., Segment the Lebanon War 2 panels with a building intensity: a quick military launch sound, followed by sharp 'BOOM!' and 'CRASH!' effects layered to crescendo with the narrated failure, ensuring audio matches the escalating chaos., The 'Winograd investigation' needs a suspenseful, slightly distorted hum or a rapid, rhythmic 'tick-tock' to emulate a SHIELD-style interrogation, creating palpable tension.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting all these distinct audio and narrative cues into the strict 65-second duration without sacrificing clarity or impact. Each segment needs to be extremely concise.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all these distinct visual and audio cues into the ~65-second target duration without feeling rushed or losing clarity, particularly with the rapid shifts between war, investigation, and personal reflection.",
      "Ensuring that the rapid-fire sequence of distinct sound effects and vocal styles doesn't overwhelm the viewer or lead to audio muddiness on Instagram's platform is a primary concern. Each element needs to be distinct yet cohesive."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Sound Design: Employ exaggerated comic sound effects like 'POW!', 'WHAM!', 'CLANK!' for visual gags and key actions. For 'SHIELD-style interrogation,' use a low, pulsing synth or subtle static. The 'Infinity Gauntlet' offer needs a powerful, almost overwhelming whoosh or shimmer effect, while corruption panels can feature cascading 'cha-chings' and a subtle multiplying hiss.",
      "Voice Style: Adopt a 'trailer voice' style for narration, characterized by a deep, resonant tone that can shift to urgency and even a hint of dramatic gravitas for impact. For Olmert's dialogue, deliver it with a mix of shock, frustration, and a touch of weary resignation, ensuring it cuts through the sound design.",
      "End the 'Memoir writing' panel with a fading, melancholic piano note or a soft sigh to perfectly encapsulate the 'thought bubble despair' and the wistful 'if only they knew...'",
      "The 'Winograd investigation' needs a suspenseful, slightly distorted hum or a rapid, rhythmic 'tick-tock' to emulate a SHIELD-style interrogation, creating palpable tension.",
      "Audio Duration Compliance: Meticulously time each sound effect and vocal segment to fit within the 65-second target. Prioritize punchy, short bursts of audio to convey maximum information and impact per segment, ensuring no wasted milliseconds.",
      "Ensure the 'SHIELD-style interrogation' and 'Iron Man armor REMOVAL' sequences have distinct audio cues; a metallic 'CLANK!' for the armor removal, perhaps a subtle, tense hum for interrogation, and a reverberating echo for Olmert's cell lines to emphasize isolation and regret.",
      "For the 'Surprise PM Panel,' use a sharp 'POW!' or 'WHOA!' sound effect synchronized with Olmert's stressed delivery of 'I didn't ASK for this!', immediately followed by a subtle, high-pitched 'spider-bite' sting for dramatic flair.",
      "The overall voiceover should maintain a slightly heightened, narrative tone, reminiscent of a comic book narrator, with vocal inflections tailored to each segment's emotional weight and comedic timing.",
      "For the 'Spider-bite style' and 'LAUNCHING ATTACK!' segments, prioritize sharp, punchy sound effects that immediately convey action and surprise, like a sudden 'thwip' for the bite and a powerful, building rocket launch sound that abruptly cuts to chaos.",
      "Segment the Lebanon War 2 panels with a building intensity: a quick military launch sound, followed by sharp 'BOOM!' and 'CRASH!' effects layered to crescendo with the narrated failure, ensuring audio matches the escalating chaos.",
      "Corruption panels require a chaotic blend: rapid 'cha-ching' sounds for cash, accompanied by a multiplying, hissing sound effect for the 'Hydra heads' to represent the growing corruption.",
      "The 'Cell echo' for 'I almost made PEACE!' should have a distinct reverberation to convey isolation, making the regretful statement more poignant.",
      "The 'Prison fitting' needs precise audio for the 'Iron Man armor REMOVAL sequence,' starting with a metallic 'CLANK!' as it disengages, followed by a whirring or scraping sound before abruptly cutting to the stark silence of prison stripes.",
      "Ensure each 'panel' transition is abrupt and visually reinforced with a quick sound effect or a change in audio texture to maintain the comic book feel and aid segmentation within the 65-second limit.",
      "Audio Approach: Segment the audio tightly, dedicating distinct soundscapes and vocal delivery to each described 'panel.' Think rapid transitions between dramatic stings for major events ('BOOM!', 'CRASH!') and subtle, atmospheric cues for investigative or reflective moments.",
      "For the 'Secret Talks' panel, introduce a subtle, regal fanfare for 'Offers Jerusalem' and a dramatic, echoing flourish for 'Take the INFINITY GAUNTLET!' to convey the gravity and ambition."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To make the 'Marvel Comics accident' narrative engaging on Instagram, we must embrace its inherent comic book style with sharp, dynamic audio cues for each panel. Prioritize a fast-paced audio-visual sync that mirrors comic book pacing to maintain viewer attention within the tight 65-second window.",
      "For this 'Marvel Comics accident' narrative on Instagram, a hyper-stylized audio approach is crucial, blending dramatic voiceovers with impactful, comic-book-esque sound effects to match the visual panels. The voice strategy should lean into exaggerated tones and pacing to convey the chaotic, dramatic, and often absurd nature of the described events within the 65-second constraint.",
