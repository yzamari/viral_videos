Each segment's audio will be meticulously mixed to match the visual pacing, with sound effects and music enhancing the narrative., Prioritize audio-visual sync for maximum impact. The 'Ant-Man' materialization should be accompanied by a distinct shrinking/growing sound effect. The 'overshadowed' montage requires a fast, percussive beat and the rustling of papers. Diplomatic skills will be underscored by a subtle, sophisticated musical score. The villain reveal needs a deep, resonant sound, and the post-credit scene a lighter, comedic tone with a clear dialogue delivery for the Stan Lee cameo., Segmenting the Ant-Man materialization and initial question into a sharp 3-second opening visual with a quick on-screen text for dialogue.

The visual and narrative elements must clearly transition from lighthearted comparison to highlighting genuine historical impact.",
          "**Stan Lee Cameo Authenticity:** The effectiveness of the Stan Lee cameo hinges on its briefness and its ability to land the final point. If it feels forced or too long, it could detract from the core message.",
