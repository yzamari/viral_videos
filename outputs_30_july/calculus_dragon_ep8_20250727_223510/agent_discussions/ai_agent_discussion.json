One-sided limits are like approaching a landing strip from the left or the right. A sudden jump indicates a discontinuity. No teleporting is allowed mid-flight. Continuity means our flight is a single, unbroken path. The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees we can fly to any altitude between two points",
