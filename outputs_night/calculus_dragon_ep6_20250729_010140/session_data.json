  "mission": "EPISODE 6: Power-Up Dragon Mathematics!! Show this as HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects! Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon in power-up workshop teaches rational and real exponents, then explores topology. Cover fractional powers, real exponents as limits, accumulation points, isolated points, open and closed sets, interior and closure, and the Cantor set. Use visual metaphors: power transformations, dragon gatherings, bubble zones, fractal magic. Make topology concepts accessible and fun.",

[VISUAL: Baby dragon in a workshop, using tools on a glowing 'power crystal' representing a fractional exponent.] DIALOGUE: Fractional powers are like magic roots, turning power into smaller, tastier flames. [VISUAL: More dragons appearing, forming a shimmering cloud around the baby dragon. Numbers flow like energy streams.] DIALOGUE: Real exponents are infinite dragon gatherings, limits shaping their true power. [VISUAL: Dragons separating into distinct 'bubble zones', some with isolated points.] DIALOGUE: Topology is about dragon shapes and connections, not just counting fireballs. [VISUAL: The Cantor set appears as a shimmering, infinitely detailed fractal magic pattern made of dragon dust.] DIALOGUE: Even these intricate fractal magic patterns have special dragon math secrets!",
    "final_script": "Welcome, young dragons, to the power-up workshop! Fractional powers are like magic roots, transforming power into smaller, more manageable flames. Real exponents represent infinite dragon gatherings, their limits shaping true power. Topology explores dragon shapes and their connections, beyond simply counting fireballs. Even intricate fractal magic patterns hold special mathematical secrets for dragons. Mastering these concepts unlocks unimaginable power for you all. Embrace the challenge, young ones, and let your flames soar",
