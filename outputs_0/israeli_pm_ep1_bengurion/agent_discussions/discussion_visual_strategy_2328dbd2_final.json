    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Implement a highly stylized visual aesthetic with bold linework, exaggerated perspective, and vibrant comic-book coloring for all panels. Use \"Kirby Dots\" energy effects for the kibbutz building sequence to directly translate the prompt's creative instruction., Synchronize dynamic comic book sound effects (BOOM, SNAP, KA-POW, WHOOSH) with corresponding visual actions. Integrate short, punchy voiceovers for iconic lines like 'I am... INEVITABLE!' and the 'Finally, peace.' thought bubble to enhance the narrative impact., Allocate approximately 7-8 seconds per major action panel (e.g., Ben-Gurion's emergence, the Mandate's vanishing, the declaration of independence) to allow for impactful animation and sound design, ensuring all 8 key segments fit within the 65-second target.",
