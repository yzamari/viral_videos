      "message": "For this delightfully absurd premise, the narrative flow must be incredibly tight and immediate, leveraging the 'breaking news' style to deliver the shock value upfront. The comedic 'emotional beat' will derive from the sheer incongruity, escalating rapidly towards a punchline that leaves the audience in bewildered amusement.",

      "reasoning": "A 30-second comedy relies on rapid setup and payoff; exploiting viral content patterns means maximizing the initial hook and sustaining the absurdity with zero wasted time. Every line and visual beat must contribute directly to the escalating humor.",
      "suggestions": [
        "**Script Structure:** Open with a serious, authoritative voice-over (e.g., 'BREAKING NEWS...') followed immediately by an equally serious character reacting to the 'unicorn' information with a deadpan delivery, then cut to a brief, absurd visual or sound effect.",
        "**Dialogue & Pacing:** Dialogue should be concise and punchy, perhaps featuring two characters with contrasting reactions \u2013 one attempting to be serious/analytical about unicorns, the other in complete disbelief. Rapid-fire exchanges and quick cuts will amplify the comedic timing.",
        "**Hook & Punchline:** The title is the primary hook. The script's opening line should immediately confirm the premise. The closing punchline should be a final, unexpected twist or a character's utterly defeated, bewildered statement that encapsulates the whole ridiculous scenario.",
        "**TTS Optimization:** Keep sentences short and clear. Use punctuation (e.g., ellipses for pauses, exclamation marks for emphasis) to guide TTS pacing and inflection. Ensure names or made-up terms related to 'unicorn warfare' are easy for TTS to pronounce consistently."

        "Ensuring the humor lands as purely fantastical absurdity, without inadvertently crossing into any genuinely sensitive territory, requires careful wording and a laser focus on the fantastical element.",

      "message": "Leveraging a 'breaking news' style provides an excellent framework for creating authentic and reactive dialogue, emphasizing the shock and escalating absurdity. We must ensure distinct character voices for anchors and reporters to maximize comedic impact, especially as their composure breaks down, and optimize dialogue for natural conversational flow and TTS readability.",

        "Script distinct vocal profiles for the news anchor (initially professional, then bewildered) and any field reporters (increasingly flustered).",
