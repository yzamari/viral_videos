          "message": "To make this \"Marvel Comics mega-episode\" truly pop on Instagram, we need a voiceover that mirrors the rapid-fire, epic storytelling of Marvel. Think dramatic, booming pronouncements for Netanyahu's 'inevitable' line, a sharp, almost glitchy effect for the time loop montage, and playful, exaggerated tones for the Trump bromance panels, all punctuated by sharp sound design. Every segment must be visually distinct and aurally impactful to maintain engagement within the tight 65-second timeframe.",
