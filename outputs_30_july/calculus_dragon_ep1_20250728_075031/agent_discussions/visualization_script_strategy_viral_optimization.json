          "message": "To maximize engagement for 'Numbers Are My Friends!!' on Instagram, we'll use a rapid-fire, joke-a-second approach, introducing each number set monster with distinct, over-the-top visual and sound effects. Each battle segment needs to be extremely short, delivering a quick property explanation and a punchline before transitioning to the next, ensuring the 35-second runtime is packed with humor and learning. The viral potential lies in the absurdity of combatting math concepts with Family Guy-esque action and Marvel-style explosions, creating highly shareable moments.",

This requires punchy dialogue and visuals that immediately convey the number property and a joke, creating rapid-fire engagement and shareability. The audio must sync explosively with every action, making the educational points as exciting as the combat.",
