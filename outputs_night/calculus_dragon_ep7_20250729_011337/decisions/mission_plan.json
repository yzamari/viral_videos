  "mission_statement": "EPISODE 7: Function Dragon Transform!! Show this as HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects! Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon shape-shifter teaches functions. Explain transformation rules, domain and range, one-to-one and onto functions, bijections, function composition, even/odd functions, and periodic functions. Use visual metaphors: dragon transformation machine, territory maps, mirror and rotational symmetry. Make abstract function concepts concrete and entertaining.",
