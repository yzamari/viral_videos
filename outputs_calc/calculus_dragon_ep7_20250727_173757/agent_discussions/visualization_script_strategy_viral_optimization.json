Each core concept (function definition, domain, range, one-to-one, onto, composition, even/odd, periodic, limits) will have its own distinct, short visual segment (~8-10 seconds), featuring the dragon changing form.  This approach, combined with energetic narration and on-screen text, will make abstract mathematical concepts accessible and engaging, fostering a sense of wonder and understanding about functions within the 63-second timeframe.",
