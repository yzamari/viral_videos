      "suggestions": [
        "**Visual Metaphor Synchronization:** For fractional powers, have the dragon sneeze 'partial fire blasts' that expand or contract. For real exponents as limits, visualize a dragon's tail extending infinitely towards a pile of enchanted snacks.  For accumulation points, depict a chaotic dragon gathering where points (dragons) naturally cluster. Use 'bubble zones' for open sets and the 'dragon cave' as a closed set.",
        "**Cantor Set Visualization:** Represent the Cantor set as a fractal pattern of shrinking dragon nests or fragmented dragon scales that progressively 'disappear' into nothingness, adding to the absurd magic.",
        "**Pacing for Instagram:** Each mathematical concept should be introduced and explained with a punchy dialogue and a corresponding visual gag within 2-3 seconds to maintain audience engagement and fit within short-form constraints, especially for an 'Unknown Duration' target.",
        "**Dialogue Brevity:** Ensure each line of dialogue is short, punchy, and directly tied to the visual gag and the math concept being explained. Aim for a maximum of two short sentences per segment to facilitate subtitle readability and rapid comprehension."

        "Ensuring the 'Unknown Duration' can be precisely managed within Instagram's typical short-form video lengths (e.g., Reels) is crucial. Without a fixed duration, there's a risk of either rushing the content or making it too long for optimal engagement on the platform."
