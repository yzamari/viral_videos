    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Segment each core event into distinct visual 'panels' (2-3 seconds each) with sharp cuts and bold, comic-style text overlays for dialogue and sound effects ('SURPRISE!', 'BOOM!', 'CRASH!', 'CLANK!')., Utilize strong visual metaphors like the 'Infinity Gauntlet' and multiplying 'Hydra heads' with dynamic graphics to quickly convey complex ideas, reinforcing the comic theme and aiding rapid comprehension., Utilize distinct visual styles for each 'panel' \u2013 think bold graphic overlays, comic book sound effect text (BOOM, CRASH), and sharp transitions to mimic panel flips.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting all these distinct visual and audio cues into the ~65-second target duration without feeling rushed or losing clarity. Each segment needs to be very short and impactful, demanding precise editing.",
      "Ensuring that the sound design genuinely enhances the narrative and doesn't just add noise is critical. Each effect must serve the storytelling purpose and avoid becoming overwhelming.",

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Implement a 'SHIELD-style' ambient hum and rhythmic clicks for the Winograd investigation panels to create a suspenseful interrogation feel. The 'INFINITY GAUNTLET' offering needs a dramatic, resonant sound flourish.",
      "Ensure the 'Iron Man armor REMOVAL' sequence has a distinct 'CLANK!' sound, followed by a metallic peeling or whirring, for maximum impact, and that Olmert's final line has a melancholic echo to create a sense of isolation and regret.",
      "Utilize distinct visual styles for each 'panel' \u2013 think bold graphic overlays, comic book sound effect text (BOOM, CRASH), and sharp transitions to mimic panel flips.",
      "Segment each core event (e.g., 'Spider-bite style', 'LAUNCHING ATTACK!', 'SHIELD-style interrogation') into distinct, brief visual panels (2-3 seconds each), with sharp cuts and impactful sound effects (e.g., 'BOOM!', 'CRASH!', 'CLANK!').",
      "For 'Corruption Panels', use a rapid, overwhelming sequence of cash register 'cha-chings' and a multiplying 'Hydra head' sound effect. This will quickly convey the narrative visually and aurally.",
      "Segment each core event into distinct visual 'panels' (2-3 seconds each) with sharp cuts and bold, comic-style text overlays for dialogue and sound effects ('SURPRISE!', 'BOOM!', 'CRASH!', 'CLANK!').",
      "Conclude with a soft, fading ambient sound and a thought bubble graphic with a despairing sigh for the memoir panel to drive home the emotional weight.",
      "The 'Lebanon War 2' segment needs rapid-fire, escalating sound effects: a military launch, followed by layered 'BOOM!' and 'CRASH!' effects to intensify the sense of things going wrong.",
      "The 'Winograd investigation' and 'Secret talks' panels should employ suspenseful soundscapes. Consider a 'SHIELD-style' electronic hum for interrogation and a dramatic flourish for the 'Infinity Gauntlet' offer to heighten tension.",
      "For the 'Surprise PM Panel,' use a sharp 'SURPRISE!' sound effect that cuts off abruptly, followed by Olmert's dialogue with a slight vocal distortion and a subtle 'spider-bite' sting. This immediately grabs attention.",
      "For Corruption Panels, a rapid succession of 'cha-ching' sounds and a multiplying, insidious hiss for Hydra heads will visually and audibly convey the concept.",
      "Utilize strong visual metaphors like the 'Infinity Gauntlet' and multiplying 'Hydra heads' with dynamic graphics to quickly convey complex ideas, reinforcing the comic theme and aiding rapid comprehension.",
      "The 'Iron Man armor REMOVAL' sequence requires a distinct 'CLANK!' followed by metallic peeling sounds, leading into the stark silence of the prison cell. Olmert's 'I almost made PEACE!' should have a pronounced, melancholic echo.",
      "Segment the video into distinct comic panels (2-4 seconds each) with bold graphic overlays and quick cuts. For 'LAUNCHING ATTACK! Everything goes WRONG! BOOM! CRASH!', layer intense, escalating military-style sound effects and impacts, building tension rapidly.",
      "To enhance viral potential, lean into the absurdity and visual metaphors. The 'Infinity Gauntlet' offer and 'Hydra heads' of corruption are prime opportunities for shareable, meme-able graphics that amplify the Marvel comic style."
