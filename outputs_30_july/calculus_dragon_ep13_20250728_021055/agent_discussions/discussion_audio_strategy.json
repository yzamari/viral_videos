    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Assign each mathematical concept (domain, critical points, derivatives, inflection points, asymptotes) a distinct 'evidence tag' or 'witness statement' the dragon detective interacts with, employing rapid visual cuts and distinct audio cues for each., Utilize exaggerated 'mood swings' for concavity, visually represented by the dragon's eye glow or breath intensity, directly linking to the second derivative test's findings to maintain comedic impact and clarity., For the 'domain,' the dragon detective could be seen busting through a 'boundary' to start his investigation, with the excluded values being areas he can't access, humorously represented by 'Do Not Enter' signs he crashes into.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting all the required mathematical concepts (domain, critical points, first/second derivatives, inflection points, asymptotes, curve sketching) into a 35-second video without making it feel rushed or sacrificing clarity. Each step needs to be digestible yet informative.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all systematic function analysis steps into the 35-second limit without sacrificing clarity or the comedic Family Guy-style pacing, especially when explaining complex calculus concepts.",
      "The primary concern is cramming the entire systematic function analysis process into 35 seconds without overwhelming the audience or losing the comedic tone. Each concept needs a punchy visual and dialogue to move forward quickly."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Assign distinct visual metaphors for each step: Domain as 'crime scene boundaries,' critical points as 'shifty suspects' identified by 'first derivative tremors,' and concavity as the dragon's 'mood swings' shown through breath color changes. This reinforces the detective theme.",
      "Prioritize split-second visual gags and rapid dialogue pacing, ensuring each mathematical concept is introduced and resolved within a few seconds to maintain viewer attention and hit the 35-second mark effectively.",
      "The 'first derivative' could be visualized as the dragon's breath creating subtle heat ripples around points, making 'suspect' functions visibly 'sweat' or 'flicker' when their slope changes, indicating critical points. For the 'second derivative,' his breath could change color and intensity \u2013 a bright, hot flame for concave up, and a sputtering, cooler flame for concave down, with exaggerated sighs for inflection points.",
      "Assign each mathematical concept (domain, critical points, derivatives, inflection points, asymptotes) a distinct 'evidence tag' or 'witness statement' the dragon detective interacts with, employing rapid visual cuts and distinct audio cues for each.",
      "Utilize exaggerated 'mood swings' for concavity, visually represented by the dragon's eye glow or breath intensity, directly linking to the second derivative test's findings to maintain comedic impact and clarity.",

    "consensus_points": [
      "To maximize engagement for this Family Guy-style function analysis comedy on Instagram, we must ensure every visual gag directly supports the mathematical concept. The dragon detective's 'case files' can be the functions, with each investigative step (domain, derivatives, etc.) being a clue or suspect, keeping the narrative focused and humor relevant.",
      "To ensure this Family Guy-style function analysis comedy is engaging on Instagram and memorable, we must synchronize the detective's investigation steps with distinct visual gags and rapid-fire dialogue. Each mathematical concept should be a 'clue' or a 'suspect' within a mini-case file, with the dragon detective's 'mood swings' directly illustrating concavity changes for maximum comedic and educational impact.",
      "To ensure the Family Guy-style function analysis comedy is both engaging on Instagram and effective in teaching, we must synchronize rapid-fire visual gags with concise explanations, assigning unique 'case file' elements to each mathematical concept. This approach will maximize memorability and potential virality."

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing rapid-fire visual gags and clear, concise dialogue from the dragon detective is crucial for both memorability and virality on Instagram within the 35-second timeframe. This approach directly addresses the challenge of balancing complex math with fast-paced comedy.",
    "Prioritizing visual gags directly tied to mathematical concepts, presented through the detective's case files, will make the complex process digestible and entertaining within the short Instagram format. This approach directly addresses the need for clarity and humor in a concise delivery.",
    "This strategy directly addresses the core challenge of balancing educational content with a specific comedic style and platform constraints. By linking each mathematical step to a visual gag and a 'case file' metaphor, we create a cohesive, memorable narrative that resonates with the target audience."
