00:00.000 --> 00:02.286
Functions are like transformation
machines.

00:02.286 --> 00:02.743
Input

00:03.043 --> 00:05.002
a roar, output a chair.

00:05.002 --> 00:05.394
The

00:05.694 --> 00:07.958
domain includes all possible inputs.

00:07.958 --> 00:08.411
The

00:08.711 --> 00:11.297
range is only the outputs created.

00:11.597 --> 00:14.862
One-to-one functions have one input for

00:15.162 --> 00:16.146
each output.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.114
Onto functions use all

00:18.414 --> 00:18.962
possible outputs;

00:18.962 --> 00:20.060
there are no leftovers.

00:20.360 --> 00:24.069
Bijections are perfect one-to-one and onto

00:24.369 --> 00:24.913
transformations.

00:24.913 --> 00:27.634
Function composition chains
transformations together.

00:27.934 --> 00:29.275
Even functions are symmetrical;

00:29.275 --> 00:29.946
odd functions

00:30.246 --> 00:31.617
are rotationally symmetrical.

00:31.617 --> 00:32.989
Some functions repeat

00:33.289 --> 00:36.267
their output, like a broken record
