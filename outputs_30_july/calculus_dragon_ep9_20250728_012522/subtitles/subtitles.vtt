00:00.000 --> 00:03.997
Alright, Stewie, we are finding treasure
on this map section!

00:04.297 --> 00:09.208
The Extreme Value Theorem indicates the
best and worst loot

00:09.508 --> 00:11.373
is at the edges or peaks.

00:11.373 --> 00:12.616
This dragon's velocity is

00:12.916 --> 00:13.240
uniformly continuous;

00:13.240 --> 00:13.888
it will not teleport.

00:13.888 --> 00:14.536
Derivatives represent dragon velocity;

00:14.836 --> 00:16.774
they show our speed at any point.

00:16.774 --> 00:17.605
If a function

00:17.905 --> 00:20.099
is differentiable, it is continuous,
unlike this bumpy dragon ride.

00:20.399 --> 00:25.441
We must use this to our advantage during
this treasure

00:25.741 --> 00:26.033
hunt.

00:26.033 --> 00:28.667
The map shows a clear path, let us
follow

00:28.967 --> 00:29.677
it carefully.

00:29.677 --> 00:32.164
Remember, Stewie, patience is key to
success.

00:32.164 --> 00:32.519
We

00:32.819 --> 00:35.196
do not want to anger the dragon.

00:35.196 --> 00:36.215
This treasure is

00:36.515 --> 00:36.787
worth the effort.

00:36.787 --> 00:37.423
Our success depends on precision and
timing.

00:37.423 --> 00:37.785
Are you ready, Stewie?

00:37.785 --> 00:38.239
Let us proceed with caution
