        "Utilize punchy, exaggerated sound effects for all 'monster' types (e.g., cartoonish crunch for cookie zombies, sharp cracking for ice demons, splat for pizza ninjas, distorted whoosh for spirals) to align with the Family Guy comedy style. Prioritize Marvel-style impact sounds for explosions and dragon fire.",
        "Ensure tight audio-visual synchronization between Epsilon's dialogue explaining number properties and the corresponding monster attacks; the audio cues for learning should be as impactful as the combat sounds.",
        "Create a distinct, memorable sound for Professor Epsilon's 'dragon fire' attack that can be used to transition between battles and reinforce his character. This sound should be impactful yet convey a hint of his academic nature."
