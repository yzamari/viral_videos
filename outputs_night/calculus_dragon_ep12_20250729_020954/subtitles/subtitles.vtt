Ball!

00:03.905 --> 00:07.405
Today, we unlock the magic of Taylor

00:17.318 --> 00:20.165
Errors shrink, predictions soar!

00:20.465 --> 00:24.984
Even proving 'e' is irrational is a
mystical quest we shall conquer.

00:25.284 --> 00:27.687
Power series are not just math;

00:27.987 --> 00:30.835
they are accessible, wonderful magic!
