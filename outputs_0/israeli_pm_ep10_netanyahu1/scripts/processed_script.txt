Distinguished faculty, esteemed guests, fellow graduates. Today marks a momentous occasion. My name is Bibi Netanyahu; I am from Israel. I am ready to lead.  A narrow victory, just one percent separated me from my opponent. The people have spoken. The Western Wall tunnel opening unleashed chaos. Spirits escaped, dissolving peace.  Cigars and champagne flowed; a celebratory atmosphere filled the air.  Sara, however, entered a furious rage.  She unleashed her anger upon my political foes. The coalition unexpectedly collapsed. My heroic allies scattered. I disbanded the ranks. I will return, stronger and more determined.  I will practice in mirrors, honing my image. One day, I will be the longest-serving leader. My vision for Israel is clear, unwavering, and powerful. I will not be deterred. I will prevail.
