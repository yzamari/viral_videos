    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Prioritize aggressive cuts and impactful sound design for each described action: 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', 'WHAM!'. Ensure each sound effect is distinct and complements the visual, creating a rapid-fire, attention-grabbing experience., Map the dialogue and sound cues to specific visual moments to maintain a rapid pace. For instance, 'CRASH!' should coincide with the wall breach, and 'I am eternal!' should have a strong vocal presence with a visual flourish., Prioritize dynamic transitions between each described action (e.g., crash, whoosh, boom, zap) to maintain a consistent high-energy pace and visual interest.",
