The 3-second title card needs an explosive audio-visual hook. Subsequent segments should showcase distinct number sets battling with exaggerated Family Guy-esque humor and Marvel-style action, with Professor Epsilon delivering punchy, educational quips during combat.  The overall technical approach should be fast-paced editing, ensuring clear visual cues for both the comedy and the mathematical concepts within the 35-second duration.",
