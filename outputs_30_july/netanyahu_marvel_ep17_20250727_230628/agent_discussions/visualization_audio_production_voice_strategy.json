The audio needs to convey the high-octane, comic-book feel while ensuring the distinct sounds like 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', and 'ZAP!' punctuate each described event without becoming a sonic mess.",

The vocal performance needs to be dynamic and authoritative to match the 'eternal' pronouncements and comedic exaggeration, with sound effects driving the pacing and reinforcing the comic book aesthetic.",

The narrator should deliver lines with urgency and flair, matching the rapid-fire visual cues and sound effects. For optimal engagement on Instagram within 35 seconds, the vocal performance must be dynamic, punctuating key phrases like 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' with distinct emphasis, ensuring each segment is clear and impactful.",
