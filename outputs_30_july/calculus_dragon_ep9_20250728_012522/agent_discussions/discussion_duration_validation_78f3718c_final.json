    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For the Extreme Value Theorem, visualize the dragon finding the absolute highest pile of gold (max) and the lowest empty chest (min) within a specific treasure cavern (closed interval)., Use the dragon's flight path to visually represent derivatives; show a speedometer on the dragon's neck for instantaneous velocity (rate of change) and its upward/downward slope for function behavior., For continuity and differentiability, contrast a smooth, continuous flight path with a path that has sudden 'jumps' or 'breaks' in its trajectory, illustrating discontinuous and non-differentiable points.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Fitting all the listed concepts (Extreme Value Theorem, uniform continuity, derivatives, max/min on closed intervals, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor, instantaneous rate of change, differentiability/continuity relationship) into a ~35-second video will be extremely challenging without sacrificing clarity.",
      "The primary concern is packing such dense mathematical concepts into a short, comedic Instagram video without sacrificing clarity or humor. Balancing the tutorial aspect with the comedic Family Guy style will be challenging within the tight duration.",
      "The sheer volume of mathematical concepts to cover within the tight 35-second window is the primary concern. It will be challenging to explain Extreme Value Theorem, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor theorem, and derivatives with their associated visual metaphors and comedic beats without feeling rushed or losing clarity.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the Family Guy humor and the need for accurate, albeit simplified, mathematical explanations. Over-simplification could lead to factual errors, while too much technical detail will alienate the audience and exceed the time limit."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Use the dragon's flight path to visually represent derivatives; show a speedometer on the dragon's neck for instantaneous velocity (rate of change) and its upward/downward slope for function behavior.",
      "For continuity and differentiability, contrast a smooth, continuous flight path with a path that has sudden 'jumps' or 'breaks' in its trajectory, illustrating discontinuous and non-differentiable points.",
      "Implement sound design that matches Family Guy's comedic timing and character voices, using exaggerated sound effects for treasure discoveries or dragon movements to enhance the humor and educational points.",
      "For the Extreme Value Theorem, visualize the dragon finding the absolute highest pile of gold (max) and the lowest empty chest (min) within a specific treasure cavern (closed interval).",
      "Use the dragon's flight path as a visual for derivatives; the steepness of the climb or descent is the instantaneous rate of change. Measuring slopes could be the dragon trying to gauge the angle of a cliff face.",
      "Uniform continuity can be depicted by the dragon's consistent speed when flying a specific distance, regardless of starting point within that stretch.",
      "For the Extreme Value Theorem, visualize the dragon trying to find the highest peak of treasure loot within a cave (closed interval) or the lowest point of its hoard.",
      "Prioritize visual gags for 'finding max/min on closed intervals' (e.g., dragon trying to reach the highest/lowest point of a treasure pile) and 'derivative as instantaneous rate of change' (e.g., dragon's velocity on a jagged path). The 'monotonic bijection' can be visualized as a treasure map that always leads to a unique, progressively more valuable spot, and 'Heine-Cantor' by showing a treasure chest that consistently reveals a predictable amount of gold regardless of where the dragon opens it.",
      "Allocate roughly 8-10 seconds for introducing the treasure hunt premise and the dragon character, using Family Guy-esque humor. Then, dedicate 4-5 seconds per concept (Extreme Value Theorem, monotonic bijections, Heine-Cantor, derivatives as rate of change) with corresponding visual metaphors. Ensure the relationship between differentiability and continuity is visually demonstrated in the final 5-7 seconds.",
      "The Heine-Cantor theorem might be visually represented by the dragon's guaranteed ability to find a continuous path to any treasure, even with slight adjustments to its flight plan."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To create an engaging Family Guy-style comedy about calculus concepts on Instagram, we must tightly weave the humor, treasure hunting visuals, and mathematical explanations.  Focusing on rapid-fire jokes and clear visual metaphors for derivatives and continuity will be key.",
      "To effectively translate these complex calculus concepts into a Family Guy-style Instagram comedy within the target duration, we need to prioritize punchy visual gags and extremely concise explanations. The dragon treasure hunter persona can anchor the narrative, with each mathematical concept being tied to a specific treasure-hunting scenario.",
      "To ensure synchronization across all agents for this Family Guy-style calculus comedy, we must prioritize a clear narrative thread that seamlessly integrates the treasure hunting theme with each mathematical concept. The duration constraint of 35 seconds \u00b15% necessitates exceptionally concise explanations, leveraging visual metaphors for immediate comprehension and engagement on Instagram."

    "The complex topic needs digestible, visually driven explanations that fit the fast-paced Instagram format. Family Guy's style lends itself to absurd but relatable analogies for mathematical principles, which is crucial for this specific content.",
    "Given Instagram's short-form nature and the inherent complexity of the calculus topics, a rapid-fire, visually driven approach is essential for engagement and comprehension. This allows us to hit the key points without overwhelming the viewer.",
    "Our primary focus is on coordinating the delivery of complex calculus ideas within a highly restrictive comedic format. This requires meticulous segment planning and visual integration to maintain viewer attention and educational clarity."
