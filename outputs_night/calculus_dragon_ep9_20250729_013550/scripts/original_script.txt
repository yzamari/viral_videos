[VISUAL: Huge, animated title card: EPISODE 9: Finding Dragon Treasures!! with epic fire and gold effects.] DIALOGUE: Welcome, treasure hunters! Today, we hunt dragon gold, and learn about math! [VISUAL: Treasure hunter character points to a graph with a dragon icon showing max/min on a closed interval.] DIALOGUE: To find the most treasure, we check endpoints of our quest! That's the Extreme Value Theorem in action. [VISUAL: A smooth, continuous line representing dragon flight across a map. Then a bumpy, discontinuous line.] DIALOGUE: Smooth flights mean uniform continuity; jumpy flights do not! Our dragon must fly without sudden breaks. [VISUAL: A dragon's shadow morphing to show instantaneous velocity at different points.] DIALOGUE: The dragon's speed at any exact moment? That's a derivative, the instantaneous rate of change! [VISUAL: A smooth curve representing the dragon's path. A tangent line is drawn on the curve.] DIALOGUE: If it's smooth enough to draw a tangent line, it's differentiable and continuous. Like finding treasure on a predictable path!
