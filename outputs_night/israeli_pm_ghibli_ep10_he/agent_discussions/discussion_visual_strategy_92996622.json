For example, dedicating the initial seconds to the 'high-tech flowers blooming from ancient desert sand' and Peres's posture, then transitioning to the 'colorful birds carrying startup ideas' with a subtle sound effect., Emphasize sonic details for the 'Studio Ghibli magic': use ethereal chimes for blooming flowers, soft fluttering for birds, and a gentle, warm glow for the 'bridges of light.' The Dimona reactor's sound should be a low, hum of peaceful energy, not industrial. The 'origami cranes' transformation can have a crisp, paper-folding sound. The final 'robots dancing the hora' should have a playful, upbeat synthesized tune blending with traditional instrumentation., For dialogue, keep each sentence short (around 10-15 words) and delivered with a calm, inspiring tone, mimicking Peres's wisdom.

      "suggestions": [
        "Visually, establish the 'Studio Ghibli magic' immediately with a painterly desert landscape featuring the glowing high-tech flowers. Perse's initial appearance should be gentle, with his eyes conveying wisdom and kindness. Then, transition dynamically to the birds carrying startup ideas, emphasizing vibrant colors and flowing animation. For the bridges of light, subtle shimmering effects will be key to conveying connection. The Dimona reactor needs a soft, pulsating glow, not industrial harshness. The workshop scene with origami cranes should feel intimate and magical. Finally, the robots dancing the hora requires playful, fluid motion. These scene shifts must be rapid, averaging 8 seconds per major element.",
        "The audio should be a paramount consideration for achieving the Ghibli feel. Start with ambient, ethereal sounds for the desert bloom, transitioning to light, airy chimes for the birds. The 'bridges of light' should have a warm, sustained hum. The Dimona reactor's sound should be a subtle, peaceful hum. The workshop transformation should have delicate paper-folding sounds. For the robots, incorporate upbeat, whimsical folk-inspired electronic music that blends with traditional instrumentation to represent the 'eternal optimism.' Narration should be sparse and inspirational, fitting the short segments.",
        "For TikTok virality, the opening 5-10 seconds must be visually captivating and thematically intriguing, showcasing the unique blend of desert, technology, and Ghibli aesthetics. The rapid visual storytelling and the inspirational message about dreams and innovation will encourage shares. A strong closing visual of Peres smiling as the robots dance, with the music swelling, will leave a lasting positive impression.",
        "Technically, achieving the 'Ghibli magic' requires meticulous attention to detail in animation. Motion blur and parallax effects will add depth. The color palette should be warm and inviting, consistent with Ghibli's style. For the specific elements: high-tech flowers could incorporate subtle LED-like glows, birds could have soft trails of light, and bridges of light should feel tangible yet ethereal. The Dimona reactor's peaceful glow needs careful lighting design. Robots dancing the hora should have distinct, fluid movements that feel both mechanical and joyful. Seamless transitions between these complex visual ideas within the 8-second segments are critical."

Maintaining visual clarity and thematic coherence without feeling rushed or cluttered will be a significant challenge for VEO-2.",
        "Ensuring the narrative about 'old and new Israel' and 'peace agreements' is conveyed effectively through symbolic visuals (bridges of light, origami cranes) within such brief segments, while also maintaining the whimsical Ghibli tone, requires careful scripting and visual interpretation.
