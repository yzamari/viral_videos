Behold Ehud Barak, Israel's most decorated soldier. His medals shone, a dazzling display.  They called him Israel's most brilliant Prime Minister. His intellect was renowned. At Camp David, he proposed a peace deal, a bold initiative.  Yet, Yasser Arafat rejected his every proposal. The Second Intifada erupted, a devastating conflict.  Barak, a man of many facets, once undertook a clandestine operation in disguise. He demonstrated a remarkable understanding of gender fluidity. His coalition government fractured, a swift and tragic collapse.  Victory eluded him; he suffered a crushing defeat to Ariel Sharon. It was a historic loss.  Later, on Epstein's island, he famously quipped, "I kept my underwear on!"  Now, he reflects on his legacy.
