    "reasoning": "The text content is extensive and covers multiple points related to mathematical concepts. Placing it at the bottom center allows for a good balance with the cartoon visuals, especially for a platform like Instagram where content is often viewed on mobile. It avoids the bottom 20% rule for Instagram, while keeping the text accessible and readable. Static positioning is suitable as the phrases are meant to complement the visuals throughout the duration, rather than requiring specific dynamic placement for each phrase.",
