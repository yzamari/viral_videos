The voiceover for Professor Epsilon should be energetic, slightly frantic to match the 'Family Guy' comedy and 'Marvel-style' action, and deliver educational tidbits in very short bursts. Think of it as the audio equivalent of quick cuts.",

The audio needs to mirror the described visual chaos and learning beats precisely, ensuring every explosion and quip lands within the tight 35-second window, while maintaining clarity on number properties.",
