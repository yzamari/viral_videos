Each function concept (rule, domain, range, one-to-one, onto, composition, symmetry, limits) will be presented in a 7-9 second segment, featuring the baby dragon performing distinct transformations. The narration will be energetic and concise, perfectly synchronized with visual cues and on-screen text, making abstract math concepts tangible and engaging for a general audience.",

Each concept (rule, domain, range, one-to-one, onto, composition, symmetry, limits) will be a distinct, precisely timed visual vignette, enhanced by a friendly, enthusiastic voiceover and clear on-screen text. This approach ensures maximum comprehension and engagement by making abstract mathematical ideas tangible and memorable for a general audience.",
