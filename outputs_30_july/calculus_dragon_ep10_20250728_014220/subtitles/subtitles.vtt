00:00.000 --> 00:02.529
Welcome to the first ever Dragon Calculus
Olympics!

00:02.529 --> 00:03.161
The Chain

00:03.461 --> 00:03.790
Rule Relay:

00:03.790 --> 00:05.107
each dragonâ€™s output must match the next
dragonâ€™s

00:05.407 --> 00:05.775
input!

00:05.775 --> 00:09.090
Inverse function derivatives are judged on
elegance and accuracy

00:09.390 --> 00:11.448
in the gymnastics arena.

00:11.448 --> 00:14.536
Higher derivatives and critical points are

00:14.836 --> 00:18.347
key in our treacherous mountain climbing
marathon.

00:18.347 --> 00:19.851
Fermat's, Rolle's, and

00:20.151 --> 00:25.193
Mean Value theorems are buried treasures
in our grand finale hunt
