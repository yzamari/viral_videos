  "mission": "EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!! Show this as HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects! Create a Family Guy style comedy where dragon pilot teaches function limits and continuity. Cover epsilon-delta definition, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity conditions, types of discontinuities, and the intermediate value theorem. Use visual metaphors: smooth flying vs teleporting, landing from different directions, altitude changes. Make limits and continuity intuitive through flight analogies.",

Quick cuts of a dragon soaring.] DIALOGUE: Welcome to Smooth Dragon Flights, where we make calculus take wing! [VISUAL: Dragon smoothly approaching a target. A jerky teleporting dragon appears and disappears.] DIALOGUE: We do not teleport; we fly smoothly, approaching our destination with precision, like approaching a limit. [VISUAL: Dragon landing from above vs. from the side. Split screen showing approaching altitude from left and right.] DIALOGUE: Limits must agree from all directions; smooth flying means landing from any approach works. [VISUAL: Dragon flying through clouds without interruption. Then, a dragon hitting a cloud wall and stopping.] DIALOGUE: Continuous flight means no sudden stops. Our flight path is unbroken, unlike a bumpy ride. [VISUAL: Dragon smoothly changing altitude to meet another dragon at a specific point. Then, dragon appears at target altitude instantly.] DIALOGUE: If our flight path connects smoothly, we always reach our destination. This is continuity in action!",
    "final_script": "Welcome to Smooth Dragon Flights, where calculus takes flight! We do not teleport; we fly smoothly. We approach our destination with precision, like approaching a limit. Limits must agree from all directions. Smooth flying means a successful landing from any approach. Continuous flight means no sudden stops; our flight path is unbroken. If our flight path connects smoothly, we always reach our destination. This is continuity in action",
