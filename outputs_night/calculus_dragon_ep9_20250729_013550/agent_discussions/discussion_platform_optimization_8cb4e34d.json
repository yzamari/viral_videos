The key is to ensure each segment, especially with subtitle requirements, is punchy, visually driven, and consistently reinforces the treasure-hunting theme to maintain audience engagement throughout the unknown duration.",

By weaving calculus through a comedic treasure hunt, we tap into relatable visual metaphors and leverage humor to boost watch time and shares, crucial for unknown duration content.",

        "Craft a compelling 3-second animated title card with epic effects that immediately sets a comedic, adventurous tone, hinting at the educational content to follow and aligning with Instagram's visual-first approach.",

      "concerns": [
        "The primary concern is balancing the educational depth of calculus concepts with the brevity and comedic style required for Instagram. Overly dense explanations might alienate viewers, even with Family Guy-style humor, especially for content with unknown duration where maintaining attention is paramount."
