    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Prioritize visually dynamic 'Family Guy' animation for all scenes to enhance the chaotic humor. Each visual gag, from the plunging graph to the wheelbarrow of cash, must be instantly recognizable and absurdly funny., Implement quick cuts between Maryam's report, Peter's economist take, the cutaway, and the ticker updates. The 'crooked hijab' should be a subtle visual cue, adding to the rushed, chaotic news feel without needing dialogue., [VISUAL: Wide shot of Maryam, slightly frazzled, news desk behind. Her hijab is noticeably askew.] DIALOGUE: BREAKING NEWS: Rial value drops so low, mathematicians invented new numbers.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The biggest concern is fitting all these distinct visual and dialogue elements, each with specific comedic beats, into the 40-second window without feeling rushed or losing the punchline's impact. Pacing is paramount.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the comedic elements and dialogue within the tight 40-second window without feeling rushed, which could diminish the impact of the jokes and make subtitles hard to read.",
      "Pacing is critical. Each segment must be extremely brief to fit all elements within 40 seconds without feeling rushed, which could dilute the humor. The visual gags, especially the graph and the cutaways, need to be instantly understandable and impactful."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Segment 5: [VISUAL: Fast-paced news ticker showing 'RIAL TO DOLLAR: 1,000,000:1 (UPDATED: 2,000,000:1)'. Lower third graphic appears: 'EXPERT ADVICE: Just Print More Money!'] (Approx. 5s). The ticker updates should be rapid and jarring, with a quick, authoritative voice for the lower third.",
      "[VISUAL: Quick cut to Peter Griffin at a press podium, looking bewildered.] DIALOGUE: Our economy is like my diet - non-existent!",
      "Implement quick cuts between Maryam's report, Peter's economist take, the cutaway, and the ticker updates. The 'crooked hijab' should be a subtle visual cue, adding to the rushed, chaotic news feel without needing dialogue.",
      "Ensure background audio is consistent with a chaotic news broadcast, perhaps with subtle, frantic orchestral stings that punctuate the jokes. The overall audio mix should emphasize dialogue and sound effects to drive the humor.",
      "[VISUAL: Animated graph showing a sharp, steep decline, piercing through a stylized Earth's core. Dramatic 'plummeting' sound effect.]",
      "[VISUAL: Split screen or fast-paced graphic overlay. News ticker rapidly updates: RIAL TO DOLLAR: 1,000,000:1 (UPDATED: 2,000,000:1). Lower third appears: EXPERT ADVICE: Just Print More Money!]",
      "Segment 2: [VISUAL: Animated graph plummets sharply through Earth's core, accompanied by a comedic 'whoosh' and a final 'thud'] (Approx. 3s). Use a deep, resonant impact sound for comedic effect.",
      "Segment 3: [VISUAL: Peter Griffin at a podium, looking bewildered] DIALOGUE: 'Economy's like my diet - non-existent!' (Approx. 4s). Peter's delivery should be his signature dopey tone.",
      "Prioritize visually dynamic 'Family Guy' animation for all scenes to enhance the chaotic humor. Each visual gag, from the plunging graph to the wheelbarrow of cash, must be instantly recognizable and absurdly funny.",
      "Segment 1: [VISUAL: Maryam with slightly askew hijab, earnest news desk look] DIALOGUE: 'BREAKING: Rial value drops so low, mathematicians invented new numbers.' (Approx. 4s). Ensure Maryam's voice is clear and slightly urgent.",
      "[VISUAL: Wide shot of Maryam, slightly frazzled, news desk behind. Her hijab is noticeably askew.] DIALOGUE: BREAKING NEWS: Rial value drops so low, mathematicians invented new numbers.",
      "[VISUAL: Cutaway: Two citizens struggling to push a wheelbarrow overflowing with cash for a single, tiny tomato. Followed by a Quagmire-like character gesturing wildly.] DIALOGUE: Giggity! I'll trade you my house for that sandwich!",
      "Segment 4: [VISUAL: Quick cutaway to a citizen struggling with a wheelbarrow full of cash for one tomato. Immediately cut to a Quagmire-style character] DIALOGUE: 'Giggity! I'll trade you my house for that sandwich!' (Approx. 7s). The cutaway visual needs to be absurdly detailed. Quagmire's line should have his characteristic vocalization.",
      "The 'hijab now crooked' detail should be a subtle visual gag, noticeable but not distracting, contributing to the overall sense of rushed chaos. The visual gag of the wheelbarrow needs to be instantly understandable and humorous.  The quip 'Giggity!' should be delivered with the typical Quagmire inflection for immediate recognition and comedic payoff."
