    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Develop a character arc for the baby dragon that mirrors a learning curve, making the explanations relatable and funny. For transformation rules, visualize a 'Dragon Transformation Machine' where inputs go in, and different dragon forms (outputs) come out, emphasizing the rules of this machine., For domain and range, use 'territory maps' showing the valid dragon forms the baby can transform into and the possible transformations it can perform. For one-to-one and onto, utilize character interactions: if each input transformation leads to a unique output dragon form and all possible dragon forms are covered, it's a bijection., For 'transformation rules,' show the baby dragon struggling to transform into a specific shape (e.g., a square), with the 'rule' being the constraint on its transformation, visually represented by limitations in the 'dragon transformation machine.'",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is maintaining clarity on the mathematical concepts while injecting enough humor and visual flair to keep it engaging without overwhelming the educational aspect.",
      "The primary concern is maintaining brand consistency and ensuring the humor remains sophisticated enough to appeal to a broad audience without alienating those less familiar with Family Guy's specific comedic style.",
      "The 'Unknown Duration' for the video could lead to pacing issues if not carefully managed; segments must feel energetic and purposeful throughout, avoiding any lag that could cause viewers to drop off.",
      "Condensing complex mathematical definitions into 1-2 sentence segments, while adhering to word count for subtitles, will be a significant scriptwriting challenge to maintain accuracy and clarity.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the comedic elements with accurate mathematical explanations to avoid oversimplification or misrepresentation, which could alienate learners and dilute the educational value.",
      "The success hinges on the quality and clarity of the visual metaphors and comedic timing. If the humor falls flat or the metaphors are too obscure, engagement will suffer. Balancing dense mathematical concepts with Family Guy-level silliness is a challenge."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "For 'even functions,' use a 'mirror symmetry' visual where the dragon's transformation on one side of a central axis is perfectly mirrored on the other.",
      "For 'function composition,' illustrate the dragon performing one transformation after another, like eating a spicy pepper to gain fiery breath, then swallowing a cloud to become fluffy.",
      "For 'function composition', show the dragon transforming, then immediately being fed into *another* transformation machine, creating a chain reaction of absurd dragon forms.",
      "End each segment with a call to action, like 'What function should Rusty teach next?' or a quick poll in Stories to drive engagement.",
      "For 'even/odd functions,' utilize mirror and rotational symmetry metaphors with the dragon's transformations, perhaps one transformation reflects perfectly, and another has a 180-degree rotational symmetry.",
      "For 'domain and range', use the 'dragon transformation machine' as a factory where only specific ingredients (inputs) produce certain types of dragons (outputs). Visualize the 'allowed ingredients' and 'resulting dragons' as clearly defined territories on a map.",
      "For 'periodic functions,' show the dragon repeating its transformations in a regular, cyclical pattern, perhaps tied to its feeding schedule.",
      "To explain 'one-to-one functions,' have the dragon transform into unique, distinct forms for each input, while 'onto functions' could show the dragon filling every possible space on a grid.",
      "For 'one-to-one functions,' depict a scenario where each input (e.g., a specific food item) results in a unique dragon output (e.g., a specific color of fire).",
      "For 'domain and range,' the dragon could transform into different-sized creatures that can only fit within specific 'territory maps' dictated by input and output limitations.",
      "For 'even/odd functions', use mirror symmetry for even (e.g., a dragon reflecting perfectly) and rotational symmetry for odd (e.g., a dragon that looks the same after a 180-degree spin, perhaps a M\u00f6bius strip dragon).",
      "Ensure the 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD' is impactful and visually represents the 'Function Dragon Transform!!' theme with dynamic effects and sound.",
      "For domain and range, use 'territory maps' showing the valid dragon forms the baby can transform into and the possible transformations it can perform. For one-to-one and onto, utilize character interactions: if each input transformation leads to a unique output dragon form and all possible dragon forms are covered, it's a bijection.",
      "For 'domain and range,' visualize these as 'territory maps' for the dragon. The domain is the area the dragon can enter, and the range is the area it can transform into.",
      "For 'bijections,' combine the one-to-one and onto concepts, showing a perfect mapping between food items and dragon forms.",
      "Use a 'dragon transformation machine' for composition, where one transformation feeds into the next to create a final, often comically unexpected, dragon form.",
      "For 'onto functions,' ensure every possible dragon form (output) can be achieved by some input (e.g., every type of food).",
      "For 'odd functions,' utilize 'rotational symmetry,' where transforming the dragon by 180 degrees results in an opposite but equivalent transformation.",
      "For 'transformation rules,' show the baby dragon struggling to transform into a specific shape (e.g., a square), with the 'rule' being the constraint on its transformation, visually represented by limitations in the 'dragon transformation machine.'",
      "For 'one-to-one and onto', depict the transformation machine as having distinct output slots. A one-to-one function would mean each input creates a *unique* dragon, and onto means *every* slot gets filled. For bijections, combine both with a comical mix-up or perfect pairing.",
      "Develop a character arc for the baby dragon that mirrors a learning curve, making the explanations relatable and funny. For transformation rules, visualize a 'Dragon Transformation Machine' where inputs go in, and different dragon forms (outputs) come out, emphasizing the rules of this machine.",
      "Break down each function into its own short, punchy segment (under 15 seconds each) with clear, concise dialogue and subtitle overlays."

    "consensus_points": [
      "For 'EPISODE 7: Function Dragon Transform!!', we need to maximize engagement on Instagram by leveraging the humorous, visual-rich Family Guy style. The core strategy should be breaking down complex function concepts into digestible, entertaining segments that are highly shareable and encourage interaction through comments and questions.",
      "To maximize engagement for 'EPISODE 7: Function Dragon Transform!!' on Instagram, the core strategy should focus on rapid-fire visual gags within the Family Guy style to explain each function concept. The animated title card sets an immediate tone, but subsequent segment pacing is crucial. Each function explanation needs a distinct, comical dragon transformation tied to its definition and a relatable visual metaphor to ensure memorability and shareability, especially for abstract concepts like domain and range.  The goal is to make learning functions as entertaining as watching a sketch.",
      "To maximize engagement for 'Function Dragon Transform!!' on Instagram, we should prioritize fast-paced, visually absurd transformations tied directly to each function concept, leaning into the Family Guy humor. Each function explanation needs a distinct, meme-able transformation sequence with clear, relatable visual metaphors to boost shareability and virality."
