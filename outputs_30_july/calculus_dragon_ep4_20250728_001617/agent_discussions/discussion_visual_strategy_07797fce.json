Use nested intervals with shrinking boxes that the dragon tries to fit into, becoming increasingly squished and annoyed.",
        "Show subsequences by having the dragon pick only its favorite colored snacks from a chaotic, scattered pile, ignoring the rest, then perhaps trying to count them. Bolzano-Weierstrass can be humorously illustrated by the dragon getting lost in a series of identical rooms, but each has a subtly different, repeating pattern on the wall, showing boundedness within distinct states.",
