The 3-second animated title card must be explosive with sound design to grab attention, followed by rapid-fire visual gags and clear, concise explanations of each function analysis step, all framed by the detective narrative and dragon's personality. The key is seamless integration of the comedy and education within a tightly controlled audio-visual rhythm.",

The 3-second animated title card must be punchy and set the Family Guy-esque comedic tone immediately. The core of the video needs to present each function analysis step as a distinct 'case' the dragon detective is solving, with the 'mood swings' metaphor for concavity being a key visual gag linked directly to the dragon's expression and the graph's curvature.",

The 3-second title card needs to be an auditory and visual explosion, perfectly setting the comedic, Family Guy-esque tone. Subsequent segments must be exceptionally concise, using distinct visual cues for each function analysis step, such as the dragon's 'mood swings' directly mirroring concavity, to maintain engagement and comprehension within the tight 40-second timeframe.",
