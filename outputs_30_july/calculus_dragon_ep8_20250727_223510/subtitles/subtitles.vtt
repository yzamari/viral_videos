00:00.000 --> 00:01.202
Alright, Stewie, buckle up.

00:01.202 --> 00:02.403
We are learning about

00:02.403 --> 00:03.128
limits, dragon-style.

00:03.128 --> 00:05.303
Limits are like a smooth flight,

00:05.303 --> 00:07.249
not that teleporting nonsense.

00:07.249 --> 00:09.195
We approach our destination

00:09.195 --> 00:09.499
smoothly.

00:09.499 --> 00:11.017
A perfect landing is continuity;

00:11.017 --> 00:11.624
from any

00:11.624 --> 00:12.865
direction, we arrive smoothly.

00:12.865 --> 00:14.106
Epsilon-delta means getting our

00:14.106 --> 00:16.692
flight path very close to the target
altitude.

00:16.692 --> 00:21.368
One-sided limits are like approaching a
landing strip

00:21.368 --> 00:24.875
from the left or the right.

00:24.875 --> 00:26.044
A sudden

00:26.044 --> 00:27.468
jump indicates a discontinuity.

00:27.468 --> 00:28.891
No teleporting is allowed

00:28.891 --> 00:29.195
mid-flight.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.321
Continuity means our flight is a single,

00:31.321 --> 00:32.196
unbroken path.

00:32.196 --> 00:34.821
The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees
we

00:34.821 --> 00:39.784
can fly to any altitude between two points
