        "The 'Unknown Duration' is a significant concern for Instagram. While the content is rich, it needs to be structured so that key educational and comedic moments are front-loaded to capture attention within the first few seconds, regardless of the final length. If the video exceeds 1-2 minutes, consider breaking it into a multi-part series or a Reel with a strong hook."
