Welcome to Sparky's Power-Up Workshop! Today, we master exponents. Imagine transforming a cute dragon into a fiery inferno using fractional powers - it is simply dividing the power-up!

It is all about connections! This is the Cantor set, a fractal masterpiece, a perfect example of infinity within limits. Mind blown, humans
