  "mission": "Create a Family Guy style comedy where fortune teller dragon teaches Taylor polynomials and series. Cover linear and quadratic approximations, Taylor's theorem, remainder estimates, famous series for exponential, trigonometric and logarithmic functions, and the proof that e is irrational. Use visual metaphors: crystal ball predictions, increasing precision, shrinking errors. Make power series accessible and magical.",

[VISUAL: The crystal ball image sharpens slightly, revealing a straight line.] DIALOGUE: We approximate it with a simple line, like a predictable prediction. [VISUAL: A second, more intricate line appears over the first, refining the prediction.] DIALOGUE: Then, a touch more magic, a quadratic curve, bringing clarity closer. [VISUAL: The error between the crystal ball and the approximation shrinks visibly.] DIALOGUE: Each term, a shrinking error, a purer glimpse of truth revealed. [VISUAL: The crystal ball displays a complex, beautiful fractal pattern.] DIALOGUE: Infinite terms, a perfect prediction, the true infinite magic of series unfolds.",
