We'll synchronize punchy dialogue with clear visual metaphors for epsilon-clustering (dragons in beds/blankets) and Dedekind cuts (bridges filling gaps) to ensure mathematical points are accessible and memorable.",

The key is to make the abstract concepts tangible and humorous, ensuring visual callbacks reinforce the core message of Cauchy sequences equaling convergence in real numbers.",

Prioritizing punchy dialogue with 1-2 sentence segments, each paired with a clear visual gag like dragons clustering under an 'epsilon blanket' or building 'Dedekind bridges,' is crucial for engagement within the 35-second constraint.",
