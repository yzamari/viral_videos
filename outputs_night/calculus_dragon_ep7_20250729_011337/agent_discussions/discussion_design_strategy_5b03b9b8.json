The dragon's various forms illustrate these sets clearly.  The territory map metaphor works well for domain and range, showing the dragon's possible shapes within specific boundaries."

Immediately after, use quick cuts and energetic character animation for the baby dragon to introduce each function concept with a distinct visual metaphor, like transforming into different shapes to illustrate domain/range or using mirrored movements for even/odd functions.",
        "Ensure the pacing is incredibly brisk; each function explanation should be under 5 seconds, driven by the dragon's visual gags and transformations. For example, composition could be shown by the dragon transforming into a smaller version of itself, which then transforms again. Use on-screen text overlays that are large and animated to reinforce key terms like 'Domain,' 'Range,' 'Bijection,' etc., synchronized with the visual gags."
