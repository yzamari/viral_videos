Each comedic beat, from the identical candidates to the final reveal, needs precise timing and clear visual cues within the 40-second window to maintain viewer retention and amplify the absurdity.",

Each gag, especially the identical candidates and the ballot box cutaway, needs precise visual timing and clear audio cues to land effectively within the 40-second window.  The viral potential hinges on the unexpectedness of the double Maryam reveal and the layered satirical commentary.",
