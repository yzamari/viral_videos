    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Utilize the 'crooked hijab' on Maryam as a subtle visual cue of the chaos, perhaps a brief camera wobble or her quickly adjusting it as a visual gag before delivering the line. The graph animation needs to be visceral and exaggerated, smashing through the Earth's core with appropriate sound effects to convey the economic freefall., The cutaway gags (wheelbarrows of cash, Quagmire's trade) are prime opportunities for rapid humor; ensure they are visually distinct and deliver their punchlines instantly. The news ticker updates should be fast-paced, almost flashing to emphasize the escalating crisis, and the 'Just Print More Money!' lower third is a perfect ironic sign-off that can be held briefly for impact., Visually, ensure Maryam's crooked hijab is a subtle but immediate detail, and the graph's descent into Earth's core is exaggerated with appropriate sound design to amplify the economic collapse satire.",
