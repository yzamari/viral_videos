Hey kids, I am Epsilon the Dragon! Let us explore number sets. POOF! Natural numbers, one, two, three, appear as counting cookies for my dragon treats! But wait, zero appears - I am special! Negative numbers arrive as ice one, minus two, minus three. Together, we are integers! WHOOSH! Fractions fly in as pizza , three-quarters. We are rational numbers - any fraction! The square root of two appears as an infinite spiral dragon. I am irrational - my decimal never repeats! Pi flies by, leaving an infinite trail. They form the real number line. Absolute value measures distance from zero, like dragon hugs, always positive! Intervals are dragon territories - some include endpoints, others do not. Bounded sets have limits, like a dragon playpen. For any epsilon greater than zero, we can get closer than epsilon
