The 3-second animated title card must feature an 'epic' fanfare with a strong bass and sharp percussion to grab attention immediately, then seamlessly transition into the Dragon conductor's voice.  The Dragon's voice should be charismatic and slightly exaggerated, akin to a friendly but commanding cartoon character, delivering educational content with comedic timing and distinct sound cues for the inspectors.",

Each educational segment needs sharp, clear audio cues to support the visual metaphors, especially for the Squeeze Theorem.",
