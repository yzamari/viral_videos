00:00.000 --> 00:02.795
Welcome aboard the Sequence Dragon
Express!

00:03.095 --> 00:05.786
Each car holds a term approaching its
limit.

00:06.086 --> 00:11.545
Epsilon and Delta, our expert inspectors,
ensure everything remains within bounds.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.804
Next stop, convergence!

00:14.104 --> 00:17.082
Watch these terms draw closer to their
destination.

00:17.382 --> 00:19.864
Observe the Squeeze Theorem in action;

00:20.164 --> 00:24.370
parallel tracks merge beautifully,
mirroring our converging sequences.

00:24.670 --> 00:29.529
For safety, we rely on bounded sequences,
our dependable safety rails.

00:29.829 --> 00:31.788
Hold on tight, everyone!

00:32.088 --> 00:34.021
The journey is about to get exciting
