1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,847
Hey kids, I am Epsilon the Dragon!

2
00:00:02,847 --> 00:00:04,396
Let us explore number sets.

3
00:00:04,396 --> 00:00:04,705
POOF!

4
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:05,015
Natural

5
00:00:05,015 --> 00:00:05,825
numbers, one, two, three, appear as
counting

6
00:00:05,825 --> 00:00:09,034
cookies for my dragon treats!

7
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:10,318
But wait,

8
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:12,445
zero appears - I am special!

9
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:12,799
Negative

10
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,319
numbers arrive as ice one, minus two,

11
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:17,990
minus three.

12
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,334
Together, we are integers!

13
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:19,670
WHOOSH!

14
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,871
Fractions fly in as pizza ,
three-quarters.

15
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:23,954
We are rational numbers - any fraction!

16
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:26,514
The square root of two appears as

17
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:28,589
an infinite spiral dragon.

18
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:30,145
I am irrational

19
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:32,403
- my decimal never repeats!

20
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:33,306
Pi flies

21
00:00:33,306 --> 00:00:35,153
by, leaving an infinite trail.

22
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:35,892
They form

23
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:37,146
the real number line.

24
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:38,086
Absolute value measures

25
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:43,572
distance from zero, like dragon hugs,
always

26
00:00:43,572 --> 00:00:44,173
positive!

27
00:00:44,173 --> 00:00:47,777
Intervals are dragon territories - some

28
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:49,849
include endpoints, others do not.

29
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:50,677
Bounded sets

30
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:52,027
have limits, like a dragon playpen.

31
00:00:52,027 --> 00:00:54,726
For any epsilon greater than zero, we can
get closer than epsilon
