Each segment needs to be a punchy, self-contained beat that builds momentum, reflecting the epic and dramatic arc of the story. The audio must underscore the emotional weight of each scene, from the initial defiance to the descent into chaos and eventual grim realization.",

Each scene should transition rapidly, mirroring a comic book's panel flow, and build emotional resonance through strong visual cues and minimal, powerful text.
