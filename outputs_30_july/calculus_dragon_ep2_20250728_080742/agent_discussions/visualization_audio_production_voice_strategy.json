The 3-second title card requires a booming, cinematic sound design. Each mathematical obstacle needs a unique, comical sound effect, and the Squeeze Theorem weaponization demands an iconic sonic cue to drive memorability.",

Each sonic element, from the title card's epic score to the mathematical obstacles, needs to be meticulously crafted for maximum impact and memorability within the 35-second constraint.",

          "message": "To make 'Sequence Dragon Express!!' engaging on Instagram within 35 seconds, we must synchronize a high-octane, Family Guy-esque audio track that punctuates each comedic mathematical obstacle and action sequence. The core audio strategy should focus on punchy sound effects for the title card, distinct comical noises for the 'epsilon-delta BANDITS' and their 'MATHEMATICAL OBSTACLES,' and a powerful, memorable sound for the 'SQUEEZE THEOREM' weapon.",
