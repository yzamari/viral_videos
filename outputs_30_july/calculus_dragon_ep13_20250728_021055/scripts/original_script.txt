[VISUAL: A fire-breathing dragon detective in a trench coat examining a graph like a crime scene.] DIALOGUE: This case is a mess! My dragon senses detect a function in need of some serious analysis. [VISUAL: The dragon detective marking points on a graph, zooming in on specific areas.] DIALOGUE: First, we establish the domain: where can this suspect roam? Then, critical points – our prime suspects for ups and downs. [VISUAL: Animated graphs showing the function's slope and curvature changing, with the dragon observing.] DIALOGUE: The first derivative test reveals our suspect's mood swings, defining increases and decreases. The second derivative? That’s concavity, the curve’s emotional state. [VISUAL: The dragon detective drawing dotted lines for asymptotes and marking inflection points with an 'X'.] DIALOGUE: We hunt for asymptotes, the boundaries this function respects. Inflection points are where its attitude truly changes. [VISUAL: The dragon detective confidently sketching the complete function curve based on all the evidence.] DIALOGUE: With all the evidence gathered, we sketch the complete picture. Case closed: another function’s mystery solved!
