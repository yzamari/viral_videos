00:00.000 --> 00:01.215
Greetings, fledgling mathematicians!

00:01.215 --> 00:02.429
Today, we explore

00:02.729 --> 00:05.098
natural numbers, counting cookies.

00:05.098 --> 00:06.282
A mishap

00:06.582 --> 00:06.865
occurs;

00:06.865 --> 00:08.280
we encounter integers, including negative

00:08.580 --> 00:09.098
numbers.

00:09.098 --> 00:11.689
For pizza slices, we need

00:11.989 --> 00:14.705
rational numbers - fractions.

00:14.705 --> 00:16.064
Beware irrational

00:16.364 --> 00:17.657
numbers like pi;

00:17.657 --> 00:18.950
they are infinite.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.556
All these numbers form the real

00:20.856 --> 00:25.140
number line, a universe of possibilities
