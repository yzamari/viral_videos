The voiceover should be authoritative and resonating, with subtle echo effects amplifying his 'magician' persona.

Ensure a distinct, but not overwhelming, echo effect is applied to convey the 'echoes with his powerful staff' and 'kingly' control. The line 'But beneath the magic, his heart still beats with love for Israel' should have a warmer, slightly more intimate tone to add depth.",
        "To ensure perfect sync, each segment of the script should be timed precisely to the visuals. The epic music should start subtly and crescendo dramatically, peaking during moments of perceived strength or influence, and then smoothly fade or transition for spoken lines. Sound effects like the rustle of spellbooks should be subtle, almost subliminal, while the 'typhoon of controversies' can be a low, ambient rumble that intensifies slightly when the visual focuses on this aspect."
