      "message": "For this 30-second YouTube Short, the immediate focus must be on an incredibly strong visual and auditory hook within the first 1-3 seconds to leverage the Shorts algorithm's emphasis on watch time and retention. The comedic premise of 'unicorns in war' offers high potential for virality if the absurdity is delivered quickly and clearly. Optimizing for loopability or a satisfyingly abrupt ending will also maximize replays.",

        "Utilize a visually striking opening (e.g., a 'unicorn' in a 'war zone' setting) with an immediate sound effect or comedic voiceover to grab attention instantly.",
        "Employ on-screen text overlays for key punchlines or ironic statements, ensuring they are readable within the short viewing window and enhance the comedic timing.",
        "Optimize for the 9:16 vertical aspect ratio and ensure all essential comedic elements are within the safe zones for Shorts' UI elements.",
        "Consider using a trending, but appropriate, audio clip on YouTube Shorts to increase discoverability, ensuring it doesn't detract from the core comedic premise.",

        "Leverage the 'novelty' and 'absurdity' bias by making the unicorns visually distinct and comically out of place, maximizing the meme-potential and share impulse.",
