# News Aggregation & Video Compilation Feature Design

## Overview

This feature enables automated creation of news-style video content by:
- Aggregating content from multiple sources (news articles, Telegram channels, RSS feeds, etc.)
- Extracting and utilizing existing media (videos, images) from sources
- Creating professional news edition-style videos with overlays, subtitles, and branding
- Supporting AI-generated presenters/narrators
- Enabling multi-language content generation

## Core Components

### 1. Content Aggregation System

```

#### 3.2 Composition Layers
1. **Background Layer**: Original video/image content
2. **Overlay Layer**: Theme graphics, logos, lower thirds
3. **Text Layer**: Headlines, subtitles, information
4. **AI Presenter Layer**: Virtual presenter/narrator
5. **Effects Layer**: Transitions, animations

### 4. AI Presenter System

#### 4.1 Presenter Models

- **3D Avatar Integration**: More realistic presenters
- **Voice Synthesis**: Multi-language voice generation
- **Lip Sync**: Match presenter mouth to narration

#### 4.2 Presenter Behaviors
- News reading positions
- Gesture library
- Expression variations
- Camera movements

### 5. Multi-Language Support

#### 5.1 Translation Pipeline
- Detect source language
- Translate to target languages
- Adapt cultural references
- Generate localized subtitles

#### 5.2 Voice Localization
- Language-specific voice models
- Accent variations
- Speech pattern adaptation

## Integration Points

### With Existing ViralAI System
- Leverage `DecisionFramework` for content selection
- Use `SessionManager` for tracking operations
- Integrate with existing AI providers via `AIServiceManager`
- Utilize video generation capabilities for transitions/effects

### External Services
- News APIs (for enrichment)
- Translation services
- Media processing services
- Cloud storage for assets

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Daily News Digest
- Scrape news from 10 sources
- Extract top 5 stories
- Create 3-minute video with:
  - AI presenter introduction
  - Story segments with relevant media
  - Professional transitions
  - Branded overlays

### 2. Sports Highlights
- Monitor sports news channels
- Extract game footage/images
- Generate highlights reel with:
  - Dynamic score overlays
  - Player statistics
  - Commentary narration

### 3. Tech News Weekly
- Aggregate tech blogs/channels
- Focus on product launches/updates
- Create video with:
  - Product showcase segments
  - Expert commentary overlay
  - Comparison graphics

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Parallel content fetching

## Configuration Examples

```python
news_channel_config = {
    "name": "Daily Global News",
    "sources": [
        {"type": "telegram", "channel": "@worldnews"},
        {"type": "rss", "url": "https://news.site/feed"},
    ],
    "schedule": "0 8 * * *",  # Daily at 8 AM
    "template": "professional_news",
    "languages": ["en", "es", "fr"],
    "ai_presenter": {
        "model": "news_anchor_pro",
        "style": "formal"
    },
    "output": {
        "duration": 300,  # 5 minutes
        "resolution": "1920x1080",
        "format": "mp4"
    }
}
```

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Content Sources Priority**: Which sources should we prioritize first? (Telegram, RSS, Web scraping, etc.)

2. **AI Presenter Complexity**: Should we start with simple 2D animations or aim for more realistic 3D avatars?

3. **Content Moderation**: What level of content filtering/moderation is needed?

4. **Storage Strategy**: Where should we store scraped media assets? (Local, cloud, hybrid?)

5. **Scheduling Requirements**: Do you need real-time processing or batch processing at scheduled times?

6. **Theme Customization**: How much control do users need over visual themes and branding?

7. **Language Priority**: Which languages should be supported initially?

8. **Integration Timeline**: Should this be a standalone module or deeply integrated with existing ViralAI features?
