          "message": "To make this Papaya Bar TikTok ad hilarious and engaging, we need to lean heavily into dynamic audio shifts that mirror the visual transformations, emphasizing the contrast between the epic hero intro and the mundane reality, culminating in a high-energy party scene. The audio should transition from dramatic superhero sound effects to whimsical Ghibli-esque chimes, a comforting grandma's voice, and finally to upbeat party music.  For a 32-second TikTok, rapid cuts and punchy audio cues are crucial, with a word count limit of around 89 words to maintain a brisk pace.",

The rapid transitions between Marvel, Ghibli, and party scenes, combined with the unexpected drunk guy at the end, will capture attention. For a 32-second target, each segment must be tightly edited, focusing on punchy visuals and minimal, impactful dialogue to align with TikTok's fast-paced consumption.",

The contrast between epic fantasy and relatable reality, capped with the drunk guy's order, will be the core of the humor.",
