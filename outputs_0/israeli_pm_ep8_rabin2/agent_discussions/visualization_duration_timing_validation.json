The \"Marvel Comics return\" framing allows for bold comic-style panel transitions, emphasizing the \"ICE THAW\" and \"PEACE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!\" with dynamic text and sound effects. The \"HISTORIC HANDSHAKE\" needs a sharp cut from the preceding chaos.

Rapid panel transitions, impactful sound effects for 'CLANG! BANG!' and the 'BLACK OOZE,' and visually striking representations of the 'ASSASSINATION NOIR' will capture attention.  The narrative arc should flow seamlessly from hope to tragedy, maintaining a tight pace. The duration needs careful segmenting to fit within the 61.75-68.25 second window, ensuring each key moment is impactful.",
