    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Utilize rapid cuts between panels, each featuring a distinct visual and a corresponding punchy sound effect or brief dialogue line to maintain momentum and audience attention., Employ a 'flashback' visual effect for the TIME REWIND panels and a dramatic 'shrink' animation for Kitchen Diplomacy to convey complex narrative points concisely and impactfully., Utilize a distinct visual filter or effect for each major plot point (e.g., a sepia tone for 'TIME REWIND', a vibrant burst for 'KABOOM!') to aid in quick narrative comprehension and enhance the cinematic feel.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is ensuring the narrative remains coherent and digestible despite the rapid pacing. Each distinct element of the mission brief must be visually and audibly clear enough to register without feeling rushed or lost in the visual noise.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the distinct narrative points into the tight timeframe without making it feel rushed or incoherent, ensuring each element's impact is preserved.",
      "The primary risk is information overload. The sheer number of distinct events within the mission brief, if not expertly sequenced and timed, could lead to audience confusion or a loss of emotional connection to any single moment. Careful scripting and audio synchronization are paramount."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Implement a distinct, memorable sound signature for each key event: a sharp 'KABOOM' for the Yom Kippur War segment, a distinct 'SNAP' for the transformation, and a cacophony of digital alerts and 'POW!' for the final panel to emphasize its explosive impact. This layered audio strategy enhances the comic book feel and makes each moment resonate.",
      "Incorporate animated text bubbles and sound effect interjections (like 'WHAM!', 'ZAP!') overlayed directly onto the visuals to amplify the comic book aesthetic and drive home key moments like the 'intelligence failure' or 'kitchen diplomacy'.",
      "Utilize rapid cuts between panels, each featuring a distinct visual and a corresponding punchy sound effect or brief dialogue line to maintain momentum and audience attention.",
      "Allocate precisely 4-5 seconds for each of the 8 major narrative beats. This allows for a distinct visual and auditory punch for each segment, ensuring clarity despite the rapid pacing. For example, the 'SMOKE PANEL' would have 2 seconds of visual build-up with a crackling sound, 1 second of Golda's iconic line, and 1-2 seconds for a dramatic sting.",
      "Utilize a distinct visual filter or effect for each major plot point (e.g., a sepia tone for 'TIME REWIND', a vibrant burst for 'KABOOM!') to aid in quick narrative comprehension and enhance the cinematic feel.",
      "Employ a 'flashback' visual effect for the TIME REWIND panels and a dramatic 'shrink' animation for Kitchen Diplomacy to convey complex narrative points concisely and impactfully."

    "consensus_points": [
      "To achieve the 'Marvel Comics: SMOKE PANEL!' mission, we will craft a fast-paced, visually dynamic narrative on Instagram, leveraging comic book panel aesthetics. Each segment will be roughly 4-6 seconds, featuring bold visuals, impactful sound effects (POW!, KABOOM!, SNAP!), and minimal, powerful dialogue to convey Golda Meir's commanding presence and historical impact within 65 seconds. This approach will maximize audience engagement through its high-energy presentation and emotionally resonant storytelling.",
      "To accomplish the 'Marvel Comics: SMOKE PANEL!' mission on Instagram within 65 seconds, we will employ a rapid-fire, visually stunning comic book panel sequence. Each panel will be approximately 5-7 seconds, blending dynamic animation, potent sound effects (POW!, KABOOM!, SNAP!), and concise, impactful dialogue/text overlays to convey Golda Meir's formidable presence and the narrative's high stakes. This kinetic approach leverages the platform's short-form video strengths to create an unforgettable, almost overwhelming impression of her strength and decisiveness.",
      "To accomplish the 'Marvel Comics: SMOKE PANEL!' mission on Instagram within 65 seconds, we must create a hyper-condensed, high-impact visual narrative.

The pacing will be relentless, mirroring a comic book reader rapidly flipping pages, maximizing emotional and informational density."
