Audio: Upbeat, driving synth track with occasional 'whoosh' sound effects., Segment 2 (5-15s): 'Five-month SPEEDRUN: PM achievements BLUR by! ZOOM!' Use fast-paced visual effects and a 'zoom' sound. Transition to the UN speech panel with 'TWO STATES!' audio. Immediately follow with a 'pop' or 'explode' sound effect as 'Right-wing heads EXPLODE!' text appears. Visuals: Blurred quick cuts of policy wins, then a sharp cut to a formal UN setting with text overlay. Audio: Music tempo increases, a dramatic sting for the UN speech, and a cartoonish 'explosion' sound for the reaction., Segment 3 (15-25s): 'SCANNER-STYLE!' visuals with news ticker-like text. Transition to 'TV host panels: Mirror admiration! 'HANDSOME PM!' Heart eyes everywhere!' Use enthusiastic news clips and visual 'heart' effects. Visuals: Split screens of admiring TV hosts, close-ups of 'handsome' features, heart emojis raining down.

          "The main concern is balancing the rapid-fire delivery of multiple distinct narrative beats within the tight 65-second window.

        "Script Structure: Segment the 65 seconds into 8 distinct, punchy segments averaging 8 seconds each, ensuring each segment delivers a clear narrative beat and visual gag. Use dynamic text overlays that mirror meme formats (e.g., impact font, scrolling tickers) to reinforce the 'speedrun' and 'scanner-style' elements. Prioritize audio cues like 'whooshes,' 'dings,' and comical 'explosions' to punctuate key moments and transitions, creating a highly rhythmic and engaging viewing experience that aligns with the desired darkly humorous tone. The post-credit scene should be visually distinct, utilizing a slow-motion, exaggerated 'thirst trap' pose that abruptly cuts to the ironic caption and a sharp 'click' sound.",
        "Viral Hooks & Engagement: The 'Spider-Man Arrival' serves as an immediate, attention-grabbing hook, establishing a playful, unexpected tone. The rapid-fire montage of 'achievements' followed by the 'UN speech' and 'heads explode' sequence creates a narrative of swift ascent and immediate backlash, tapping into the emotional rollercoaster of online discourse. The 'handsome PM' admiration segment uses exaggerated visual cues (heart eyes, flattering camera angles) to amplify the satire. The 'David vs. Goliath' and 'Surprised Pikachu' panels provide relatable meme formats for the campaign and loss, ensuring broad understanding and shareability. The 'thirst trap' post-credit scene, with its ironic caption, provides a strong, shareable punchline that encourages commentary and reposts, directly driving engagement."

        "Maintaining visual clarity and readability of subtitles across all fast-paced segments on a mobile screen is critical. The chosen font and size for subtitles must be optimized for Instagram's platform, and rapid scene changes could make it challenging to fully process each message.",
        "The 'right-wing heads explode' and 'thirst trap' elements, while key to the satire, risk being misinterpreted or alienating segments of the audience if not executed with precise comedic timing and visual cues. The satire needs to be sharp but universally understandable without being overly offensive or niche."
