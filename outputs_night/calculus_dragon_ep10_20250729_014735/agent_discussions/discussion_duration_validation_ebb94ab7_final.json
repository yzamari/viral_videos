    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For the title card, combine bombastic orchestral stings with sharp, fiery dragon animation to immediately grab attention and establish the 'epic' theme., Each calculus theorem should have a distinct, memorable visual and auditory motif. For example, the chain rule could be a relay race where dragons pass a calculus baton, with the sound design emphasizing quick hand-offs and building momentum. Fermat's theorem could involve dragons searching for hidden 'critical points' in a treasure hunt, with a suspenseful build-up and a satisfying discovery sound., Dedicate specific Olympic events to each theorem: Chain Rule Relay Race (dragons passing a 'function chain'), Higher Derivatives Gymnastics (complex aerial maneuvers representing second and third derivatives), and Fermat/Rolle/MVT Marathon (a race with clear start/end points and significant uphill/downhill sections).",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting all seven calculus theorems and rules into the remaining 37 seconds after the title card, while maintaining comedic timing and visual clarity. This requires exceptionally efficient scene transitions and concise explanations.",
      "Ensuring the technical explanations of each calculus theorem remain accurate and understandable within very short segments (1-2 sentences) without sacrificing the comedic Family Guy tone is a significant hurdle. Over-simplification could alienate those familiar with calculus, while complexity could bore a broader Instagram audience.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the visual metaphors for abstract theorems like Rolle's and the Mean Value Theorems are immediately understandable and humorous within the Family Guy context, without becoming overly convoluted for a quick Instagram format."

      "For 'Critical Points', consider a dragon vaulting over treacherous spikes representing maxima/minima, with the success of the vault directly correlating to finding the critical point.",
      "For critical points, envision a dragon navigating a treacherous mountain range, highlighting peaks and valleys as local extrema, with commentary on Fermat's theorem for flat terrain.",
      "Each calculus theorem should have a distinct, memorable visual and auditory motif. For example, the chain rule could be a relay race where dragons pass a calculus baton, with the sound design emphasizing quick hand-offs and building momentum. Fermat's theorem could involve dragons searching for hidden 'critical points' in a treasure hunt, with a suspenseful build-up and a satisfying discovery sound.",
      "Allocate a maximum of 5 seconds for each of the 7 calculus concepts (Chain Rule, Inverse Function Derivatives, Higher Derivatives, Critical Points, Fermat's Theorem, Rolle's Theorem, Lagrange Mean Value Theorem, Cauchy Mean Value Theorem), plus the 3-second title card. This would total 38 seconds, fitting within the 40-second target."

    "consensus_points": [
      "For the 'Dragon Calculus Olympics,' leveraging the Family Guy humor style with visually dynamic calculus concepts on Instagram requires tight pacing and audio-visual synergy. The 3-second animated title card needs to be incredibly impactful, setting an epic yet comedic tone. Each calculus event must be clearly defined with a visual metaphor, and the sound design should amplify the excitement of the 'competition,' ensuring the audio perfectly syncs with the increasingly complex visual explanations.",
      "For the 'Dragon Calculus Olympics,' we need to distill each calculus concept into a concise, visually driven Olympic event on Instagram, ensuring the humor lands without sacrificing clarity. The 3-second title card must immediately convey the core concept and tone.  We'll maximize engagement by making the visual metaphors for each theorem incredibly dynamic and the competition itself the primary narrative driver, mirroring Family Guy's energetic pacing.",
      "To maximize engagement for the 'Dragon Calculus Olympics' on Instagram, we must ensure rapid-fire visual storytelling. Each calculus concept needs a distinct, visually striking Olympic event, and the Family Guy humor should be seamlessly integrated to boost shareability.  Given the target of 40 seconds \u00b15%, we need to allocate roughly 3-5 seconds per calculus concept after the initial title card."

  "key_insights": [
    "The core challenge is making abstract calculus theorems accessible and entertaining within Instagram's short-form, fast-paced environment, and the chosen topic offers a unique, high-potential avenue for this. My approach prioritizes clear, engaging audio-visual storytelling to maximize virality and viewer retention.",
    "Instagram thrives on quick, impactful visuals and relatable humor. By framing complex calculus as competitive, character-driven events, we tap into both viral potential and educational engagement. The limited duration necessitates tight editing and clear storytelling for each segment.",
    "A tight, visually rich narrative is crucial for Instagram engagement. By dedicating specific time blocks to each concept, we can maintain viewer attention and ensure content fits the strict duration limits."
