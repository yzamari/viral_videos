    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate precise timings for each segment to ensure the overall 60-second duration is met with \u00b15% accuracy. Prioritize snappy dialogue and visual gags to maintain pacing and comedic timing., For the cutaway, meticulously sync Peter Griffin-style Iranian dad's crying to the emotional 'need' for water, ensuring Lois's voice sounds authentic and the line 'Shh, cry harder, we need to shower!' lands with comedic timing. Quagmire's line needs a distinct, slightly exaggerated vocalization, and Maryam's deadpan delivery should be sharp and concise., Allocate approximate timings: Maryam report (5-7 sec), Mahmoud cutaway setup (3-5 sec), Mahmoud and wife dialogue (10-12 sec), Quagmire cutaway (5-7 sec), Maryam deadpan punchline (5-7 sec), Tear collection center visuals (7-10 sec), Persian text overlay (3-5 sec). This pacing creates a quick, punchy feel.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Ensuring the comedic timing lands perfectly for each segment is crucial, especially with limited time. The transition between the mundane news report and the absurd cutaways needs to be seamless yet jarring, as is characteristic of the show.",
      "The primary concern is accurately replicating the comedic timing and voice characteristics of the 'Family Guy' characters within the allocated script segments and overall duration. Any misstep in voice acting or editing could detract from the intended humor and impact.",
      "The primary concern is maintaining the comedic tone and narrative clarity while fitting all elements within the strict 60-second window. Overcrowding the script with dialogue or visuals could lead to rushed delivery and a loss of comedic timing, jeopardizing the mission's effectiveness."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "For the 'Mahmoud' character, use exaggerated visual cues like a prominent tear-streaked face and over-the-top reactions to the water bill. For 'Quagmire,' a quick, suggestive wink and a distinct vocal inflection are key.",

      "Script each line for maximum brevity and comedic punch, ensuring each segment fits within its allocated time. For example, Mahmoud's 'Shh, cry harder, we need to shower!' should be delivered swiftly, with the wife's 'Mahmoud, this is ridiculous!' also being a quick, sharp retort.",
      "Allocate approximate timings: Maryam report (5-7 sec), Mahmoud cutaway setup (3-5 sec), Mahmoud and wife dialogue (10-12 sec), Quagmire cutaway (5-7 sec), Maryam deadpan punchline (5-7 sec), Tear collection center visuals (7-10 sec), Persian text overlay (3-5 sec).
