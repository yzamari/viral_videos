1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,368
Behold, a baby dragon perched atop an
endless

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:04,776
staircase!

3
00:00:04,776 --> 00:00:07,631
Monotonic means always ascending or always
descending.

4
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:08,741
This dragon is never falling.

5
00:00:08,741 --> 00:00:09,407
Bounded and monotonic

6
00:00:09,407 --> 00:00:10,049
implies convergence.

7
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:11,975
The dragon is trapped, caught in

8
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:12,911
a time loop!

9
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:14,471
Each step in this recursive

10
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:17,064
sequence depends on the previous one.

11
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:17,928
We can

12
00:00:17,928 --> 00:00:19,800
determine the limits of these sequences.

13
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,423
It mirrors

14
00:00:20,423 --> 00:00:21,080
the dragon's journey.

15
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,175
The number *e* symbol of

16
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:26,123
natural dragon growth, a key mathematical
constant.

17
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:26,687
Observe

18
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:30,671
Cantor's dragon boxes, each smaller than
the last.

19
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:34,583
Subsequences are like the dragon's kin,
related yet

20
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:35,225
distinct.

21
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:39,719
The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem assures
bounded sequence possesses

22
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:40,432
a convergent subsequence.

23
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:41,856
The dragon always finds its way
