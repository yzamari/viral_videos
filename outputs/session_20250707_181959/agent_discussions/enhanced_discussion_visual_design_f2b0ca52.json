      "suggestions": [
        "For overall style, pursue a high-framerate, fluid animation with a 'dreamy, iridescent' aesthetic for the unicorns, contrasted by a lush, vibrant 'rainbow forest' background that maintains depth and clarity despite the color saturation, allowing for distinct comedic beats.",
        "Regarding typography, choose a rounded, legible sans-serif for main text (e.g., 'Bubblegum Sans' or 'Fredoka One') for clarity and playfulness, complemented by a slightly whimsical, but bold display font for titles that incorporates subtle magical elements, ensuring strong readability across all screen sizes.",
        "Strategically compose shots with ample negative space around the dancing unicorns to allow for comedic timing and visual gags, utilizing wide master shots to establish the fantastical environment and tighter medium shots for character reactions and punchlines, adhering to cinematic framing principles.",
        "Develop a primary color palette of high-saturation pastels and bright neons for the 'rainbow forest' and unicorns, balanced with softer, complementary tones for backgrounds to prevent visual fatigue, ensuring the color psychology evokes joy, wonder, and a touch of absurdity.",
        "Implement seamless visual transitions and consistent branding across all elements\u2014thumbnails, intros, lower thirds\u2014by echoing the animated, iridescent qualities and the chosen whimsical typography to build immediate recognition and maintain narrative flow."
