      "message": "For the 'Marvel Comics accident' topic on Instagram, we need to prioritize dynamic visual storytelling and punchy audio cues to match the high-energy, chaotic narrative. Each segment should be a concise sonic snapshot, synchronized with impactful visuals to maximize engagement within the desired ~65-second timeframe.",

      "reasoning": "The prompt describes a highly visual and event-driven narrative, perfect for Instagram's short-form video format. Leveraging the 'Marvel Comics' theme allows for creative sound design that can evoke specific comic book tropes and action sequences. Synchronizing audio elements like 'BOOM!', 'CRASH!', and 'CLANK!' with corresponding visual panels is crucial for immediate impact and storytelling.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Segment 1 (Surprise PM Panel): Use a sudden, sharp sound like a comic book 'POW!' or 'SURPRISE!' effect followed by Olmert's line with a slightly amplified, stressed vocal delivery and a subtle, unsettling 'spider-bite' sting.",
        "Segment 2 (Lebanon War 2): Implement rapid-fire, escalating sound effects. Start with a military-style launch sound, then layer in 'BOOM!' and 'CRASH!' for the failures, ensuring audio intensity rises with the description.",
        "Segment 3 (Winograd Investigation): Employ a suspenseful, echoing soundscape reminiscent of intense interrogation scenes. Consider a 'SHIELD-style' subtle electronic hum or a rapid, rhythmic click track for the interrogation panels.",
        "Segment 4 (Secret Talks): Create an almost surreal soundscape with a hint of dramatic tension, possibly incorporating a subtle sound effect for 'Jerusalem offers' and a grand, yet ominous, flourish for 'INFINITY GAUNTLET'.",
        "Segment 5 (Corruption): Use a rapid, almost overwhelming sequence of cash register 'cha-chings' and a multiplying 'Hydra head' sound effect, perhaps a subtle growing hiss, for the corruption panels.",
        "Segment 6 (Prison Fitting): The 'Iron Man armor REMOVAL' needs a distinct 'CLANK!' sound, followed by a metallic peeling or whirring, then silence for the transition to prison stripes.",
        "Segment 7 (Prison Stripes/Cell Echo): A hollow, reverberating sound for the cell. Olmert's line 'I almost made PEACE!' should have a melancholic echo effect, creating a sense of isolation.",
        "Segment 8 (Memoir/Thought Bubble): End with a soft, fading ambient sound, possibly a gentle sigh or a quiet, melancholic piano note, to underscore the 'despair' and 'if only they knew' sentiment."

      "concerns": [
        "The primary concern is fitting all these distinct visual and audio cues into the ~65-second target duration without feeling rushed or losing clarity. Each segment needs to be very short and impactful.",
        "Ensuring that the sound design genuinely enhances the narrative and doesn't just add noise is critical. Each effect must serve the storytelling purpose.",
        "Maintaining audio quality across a variety of sound effects and voiceovers on Instagram can be challenging; clear mixing is essential."
