    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Incorporate a driving, perhaps subtly ominous, musical score that shifts in intensity with each panel, peaking during the assassination sequence. Use subtle \"comic book panel\" sound effects like 'WHOOSH' or 'ZAP' sparingly between key dialogue for stylistic emphasis., For the \"CLANG! BANG!\" and 'TRAITOR!' chants, use layered sound effects and a slightly distorted, echoing vocal effect to convey chaos and spreading dissent, mirroring the 'symbiote' description. The three 'BANG!' sounds of the assassination need to be distinct and impactful, followed by a resonant silence or a subtle, fading \"shield fall\" sound., Segment the script precisely for visual pacing: 'ICE THAW PANEL!' (2s), 'Rabin returns! PEACE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!' (4s), 'Oslo Accords panel: HISTORIC HANDSHAKE' (5s, emphasizing discomfort lines), 'Building peace panels: Constructing while wrenches fly! CLANG! BANG! 'TRAITOR!' chants spread like symbiote across panels! BLACK OOZE!' (10s, rapid cuts and sound design), 'Rally panel: November 4, 1995, peace song notes float.' (5s), 'ASSASSINATION NOIR: Three shots! BANG! BANG! BANG! Shield falls. 'Et tu, Yigal?'' (8s, slow-mo potential on shield fall), 'Hospital panel: Fading... 'I am... Peace Man.'' (5s), 'Nation SPLITS down middle!' (3s, impactful split graphic), 'Empty suit ceremony panel. Caption: 'Legacy: It's Complicated.'' (8s, thoughtful outro). This totals 50 seconds, leaving room for intros/outros and buffer.",

      "The primary concern is ensuring the complex narrative and emotional shifts, particularly the jump from building peace to assassination, are conveyed clearly and concisely within the short Instagram format and strict time limit without feeling rushed or disjointed.",
      "Ensuring smooth transitions between the highly contrasting tones (from 'PEACE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!' to the chaos of 'TRAITOR!' and the somber 'ASSASSINATION NOIR') is crucial to avoid jarring the viewer and maintaining narrative flow within the limited time.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the audio accurately reflects the visual progression and emotional arc of the panels within the tight time constraints. Overly complex soundscapes could detract from the core narrative. Balancing the \"Marvel Comics\" aesthetic with the serious historical content requires careful audio mixing."
