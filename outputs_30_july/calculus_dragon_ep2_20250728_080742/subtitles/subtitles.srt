1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,998
Prepare for the Sequence Dragon Express!

2
00:00:01,998 --> 00:00:02,664
Our magical

3
00:00:02,964 --> 00:00:08,006
train, full of sequences, is hijacked by
epsilon-delta

4
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:08,662
bandits.

5
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:11,153
They throw math obstacles at the brave

6
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:12,021
dragon.

7
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:15,998
Dragon blasts through epsilon tunnels with
fiery

8
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:18,355
breath, dodging obstacles.

9
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:21,784
Using bounded sequences as shields,

10
00:00:22,084 --> 00:00:25,695
the dragon valiantly fights the
convergence villains.

11
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:26,211
With

12
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:27,974
the Squeeze Theorem as its weapon, the
dragon

13
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:28,581
fights bravely.

14
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:29,042
Victory is near!

15
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:29,502
Limits are conquered
