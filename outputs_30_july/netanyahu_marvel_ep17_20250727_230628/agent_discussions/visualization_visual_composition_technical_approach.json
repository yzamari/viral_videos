Each described event, from crashing through walls to juggling trials, must be rendered as a rapid-fire, distinct visual gag amplified by powerful comic-book style sound effects. The key is to deliver iconic, easily digestible moments that align with the platform's short-form, attention-grabbing nature within the 35-second timeframe.",

The key is to treat each described action\u2014the wall crash, vanishing opposition, exploding panels, juggling trials\u2014as distinct, high-impact moments, separated by aggressive, comic-style transitions. This ensures a relentless pace, ideal for capturing attention on Instagram within the 35-second timeframe.",

Each described action, from the 'CRASH!' of walls to the 'ZAP!' of energy beams, needs a distinct, powerful sound effect that perfectly times with its visual counterpart, creating a rapid, impactful sequence for Instagram. This meticulous timing is crucial for conveying the chaos and energy of the described political commentary within the 35-second duration.",
