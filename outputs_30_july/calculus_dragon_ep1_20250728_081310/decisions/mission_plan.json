Baby dragon professor Epsilon discovers his classroom is under ATTACK by number monsters! Natural numbers are cookie-obsessed zombies, negative integers are ice demons freezing everything, rationals are pizza-throwing ninjas, and irrational numbers are infinite spiral monsters! Dragon must BATTLE each type while teaching their properties. Include epic fights, explosions, dragon fire, and ridiculous jokes. Make calculus students laugh while learning number sets through COMBAT! Add Marvel-style action effects!",
