The pacing is key to landing all the jokes within the 40-second window, making it highly shareable.",

Distinct vocal filters for Maryam and the Brian-style scientist, coupled with exaggerated sound effects for the Herbert-style elder and the 'Guess That Smell' cutaway, will amplify the dark humor and ensure quick comprehension.  The final cough and mask deployment needs a sharp, attention-grabbing audio cue.",
