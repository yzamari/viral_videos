The sound design must dynamically support each comparison \u2013 think percussive 'stone' effects for medals, a synthesized 'glow' for the brain, layered futures for Camp David, and explosive sounds for the Intifada and coalition collapse. The 'gender fluidity' line requires a nuanced vocal shift and ambient change to land the intended satire.",

Each segment should be a visual punch, with dynamic cuts and sound effects mirroring the 'Infinity Stones,' 'Mind Stone glow,' 'Doctor Strange's futures,' 'Hulk rampage,' and 'Thanos snap' descriptions to create a compelling, fast-paced story. The voiceover must convey a sharp, almost witty tone to match the satirical premise and punchy analogies, ensuring clear delivery for the 65-second runtime.",
