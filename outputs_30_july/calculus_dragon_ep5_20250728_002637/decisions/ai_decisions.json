    "reasoning": "Family Guy style implies a distinct cartoon aesthetic. Vibrant colors are engaging for a general Instagram audience and will help highlight the visual metaphors like dragon formations and colorful blankets. Cartoon style allows for exaggerated physics and character expressions, ideal for comedic explanation of abstract math concepts.",

    "positioning_strategy": "static",
    "reasoning": "The content is for Instagram, which has a user interface that can obscure the bottom portion of the screen. Placing the overlay in the bottom center still allows for visibility while avoiding the very bottom where UI elements might appear. It's a good compromise for general visibility on the platform, keeping the core visual storytelling unhindered.",

Explain the fundamental theorem that Cauchy equals convergent in real numbers, upper and lower limits, Heine-Borel theorem for compactness, Dedekind cuts, and Cauchy completion. Use visual metaphors: dragon formations, flight records, covering with blankets. Make it entertaining while explaining completeness of real numbers.",
