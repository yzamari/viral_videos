Typography should be impactful and hierarchical, guiding the viewer through the narrative with a sense of urgency and wit, while a limited, high-contrast color palette will enhance the dramatic superhero feel.",

The dark humor should be integrated subtly through visual cues and sharp, witty dialogue, leveraging a high-contrast color palette for maximum visual impact and psychological resonance.",

The visual design should mimic classic comic book panels with exaggerated shadows and dramatic angles, amplified by sound design featuring heroic stings and subtly ominous undertones.",
