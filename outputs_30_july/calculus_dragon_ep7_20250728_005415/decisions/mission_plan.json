Explain transformation rules, domain and range, one-to-one and onto functions, bijections, function composition, even/odd functions, and periodic functions. Use visual metaphors: dragon transformation machine, territory maps, mirror and rotational symmetry. Make abstract function concepts concrete and entertaining.",
