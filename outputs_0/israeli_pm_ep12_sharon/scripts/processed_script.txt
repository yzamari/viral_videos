Ariel Sharon, the Bulldozer, an unstoppable force. His legend began with sheer power.  Sabra-Shatila cast a long shadow. The Temple Mount visit ignited a firestorm. During the Second Intifada, he adopted a relentless approach.  A surprising shift followed: Gaza disengagement, settlers removed.  His own party rebelled. He declared, "Fine, I will do it myself." He forged Kadima.  A stroke struck; eight years in a coma. He died, his Gaza legacy unresolved.  His impact remains complex and debated globally.
