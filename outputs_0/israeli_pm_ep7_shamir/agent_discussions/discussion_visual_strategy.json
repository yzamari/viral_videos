    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate approximately 7-8 seconds per narrative segment (8 segments total), ensuring each panel is visually distinct and conveys its core message instantaneously with bold typography and iconic sound effects like 'SWAP!', 'CLANG!', 'CRASH!', and 'BOOM!' to punctuate scene changes and enhance the Marvel comic aesthetic., Emphasize strong visual contrasts, such as the 'Stones vs. Tanks' (David vs. Goliath) imagery and the 'Immovable Object vs. Unstoppable Force' panel, to create visceral impact and reinforce the themes of resilience and defiance.  The 'Winter Soldier style' flashbacks should be gritty and fast-paced, using quick cuts and a percussive score to establish the character's history., Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds per distinct narrative beat to ensure visual clarity and allow for the impactful delivery of dialogue and sound effects, ensuring all 8 key segments are covered within the 65-second limit.",
