    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Voice Strategy: Maryam's voice should be a clear imitation of Lois Griffin's cadence, with a Persian lilt and the characteristic wide-eyed, slightly exaggerated delivery. The Peter Griffin-style character needs the classic gravelly, dim-witted intonation. Ensure the Persian accent for Maryam is consistent and comedic, not stereotypical., Sound Design: Implement cartoonish sound effects for the water droplets running away with suitcases (e.g., tiny scurrying footsteps, 'boing' sounds on luggage). A subtle, yet upbeat news jingle for the intro and transitions, quickly cut short for comedic effect, will enhance the professional news parody. The sound of citizens licking dew should be a quick, almost slurping sound, adding to the absurdity., Timing & Pacing: Allocate roughly 7-9 seconds for Maryam's intro and the breaking news. The map animation with water droplets needs about 10-12 seconds for the visual gag to register. The Peter Griffin character's line and the citizens licking dew should occupy approximately 10 seconds total, emphasizing quick cuts. The final 8-10 seconds will be for the news ticker and the lower third reveal, ensuring the 40-second mark is hit precisely. Each dialogue segment must be concise to allow for these visual cues without feeling rushed.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Ensuring the voice actors for Maryam and the Peter Griffin-style character can accurately capture the specific comedic nuances of Family Guy without sounding like a caricature that detracts from the humor.",
      "The tight 40-second window means any slight miscalculation in timing for dialogue or visual gags will either rush the humor or exceed the limit, potentially impacting viewer retention.",
      "A potential concern is that the vocal performances, particularly for the Peter Griffin-style character, might unintentionally extend the segment beyond the 40-second limit if not carefully directed to be punchy and concise.",
      "A primary concern is ensuring the visual gag of 'water droplets running away with suitcases' is instantly recognizable and humorous within its limited screen time without feeling rushed. Over-complication could break the comedic flow.",
      "Balancing the 'professional news overlay graphics' with the chaotic, absurd animation style to maintain the parody without making it look unintentionally amateurish."

      "Sound Design: Implement cartoonish sound effects for the water droplets running away with suitcases (e.g., tiny scurrying footsteps, 'boing' sounds on luggage). A subtle, yet upbeat news jingle for the intro and transitions, quickly cut short for comedic effect, will enhance the professional news parody. The sound of citizens licking dew should be a quick, almost slurping sound, adding to the absurdity.",
      "For Maryam's 'ghosted Iran' line, the vocal delivery should be a subtle, almost bored inflection, contrasting with the absurdity of the statement, while the Peter Griffin-style character's 'Water? Never heard of her.' should be delivered with a loud, obnoxious, and entirely ignorant tone, mirroring the original character.",
      "The sound design for the water droplets running away with suitcases should incorporate quick, cartoonish footstep sounds and the faint jingle of luggage to enhance the visual gag. A sharp 'record scratch' sound effect as Maryam begins her report will immediately set the comedic, news-parody tone.",
      "Viral Potential: The absurdity of water 'ghosting' a nation, combined with the distinct Family Guy humor and topical reference (even if comedic), creates a strong potential for virality on YouTube. The quick, punchy nature of the content is ideal for short-form video consumption and easy sharing.",
      "Timing & Pacing: Allocate roughly 7-9 seconds for Maryam's intro and the breaking news. The map animation with water droplets needs about 10-12 seconds for the visual gag to register. The Peter Griffin character's line and the citizens licking dew should occupy approximately 10 seconds total, emphasizing quick cuts. The final 8-10 seconds will be for the news ticker and the lower third reveal, ensuring the 40-second mark is hit precisely. Each dialogue segment must be concise to allow for these visual cues without feeling rushed.",
      "Sound design for the water droplets running away with suitcases should be light, cartoony, and slightly frantic, like tiny running footsteps and the jingle of miniature suitcases. This will enhance the visual gag and reinforce the Family Guy style.",
      "Voice Strategy: Maryam's voice should be a clear imitation of Lois Griffin's cadence, with a Persian lilt and the characteristic wide-eyed, slightly exaggerated delivery. The Peter Griffin-style character needs the classic gravelly, dim-witted intonation. Ensure the Persian accent for Maryam is consistent and comedic, not stereotypical.",
      "For Maryam's initial report, aim for a delivery that mimics Lois Griffin's slightly weary yet authoritative tone, but with a subtle Persian inflection and a hint of amusement at the absurdity of the news. The 'ghosted Iran' line needs to land with just the right comedic timing, not too fast, not too slow.",
      "Technical Considerations: The Iran International logo needs to be a high-quality graphic, placed consistently top-right without obstructing any key visual information. The professional news overlay graphics should mimic a legitimate news broadcast for the initial contrast, making the comedic elements stand out more. The animation of the water droplets should be fluid yet comically exaggerated, ensuring the 'running away' visual is clear and impactful.",
      "To ensure the 40-second duration, each segment needs to be tightly timed: Maryam's intro (7-8 seconds), animated map (10-12 seconds), Peter Griffin cameo and citizens licking dew (10-12 seconds), and the lower third reveal/outro (8-10 seconds). Precise editing of dialogue and visuals will be essential.",
      "The Peter Griffin-style official's line 'Water? Never heard of her.' must be delivered with that classic Peter Griffin inflection \u2013 a bit dopey, dismissive, and utterly clueless. This line needs to be punchy, lasting only about 3-4 seconds to keep the pace up, and paired with a visual of him shrugging or looking utterly baffled."

      "To maximize engagement for this 'Family Guy style animated news' on YouTube, we must prioritize sharp comedic timing and rapid visual gags. The audio strategy should focus on vocal performances that embody the Family Guy essence, with Maryam delivering her lines with a slightly deadpan yet amused tone, and the Peter Griffin-style character using a gruff, dismissive delivery. The sound design needs to be exaggerated and cartoonish for the water droplets and the overall news segment to amplify the absurdity.",
