The war room crackles with tension. Countdown timers relentlessly tick down, six days until the precipice. Generals demand immediate action; attack now. The hour cries out for bold strategy. What would Ben-Gurion have done? A transformation unfolds. The mild-mannered Prime Minister becomes a wartime leader.  Eshkol, with a decisive fist-slam, makes his choice. Sinai is ours. The map explodes, territory triples in size. Jerusalem is united.  The leader's voice weakens, his final breaths shallow. The Anxious Avenger falls.  Next time: Golda's era dawns.
