      "message": "For a 10-second comedy, the script must be a masterclass in narrative efficiency, focusing on a single, absurd visual punchline that maximizes immediate comedic impact. We need to craft a setup so swift that the unicorn reveal and subsequent payoff land with explosive surprise, driving shareability.",

      "reasoning": "Short-form viral content thrives on rapid comprehension and unforgettable absurdity; a tightly constructed narrative ensures the joke's core lands instantly, hooking viewers and encouraging replays. The emotional journey, though brief, must be a sharp turn from expectation to hilarious shock.",
      "suggestions": [
        "**'Quick-Cut Absurdity Arc'**: Structure around a lightning-fast setup (1-2s), an immediate visual revelation (3-5s), and a sharp comedic reaction/punchline (2-3s).",
        "**'Expressive Minimalism in Dialogue'**: Limit dialogue to one or two impactful lines, or even just a well-placed sound effect or non-verbal reaction that amplifies the absurdity, making it TTS-friendly.",
        "**'Visual Hook Focus'**: Prioritize the visual reveal of the unicorns in an unexpected context as the primary hook, supported by swift pacing for maximum surprise.",
        "**'Emotional Payoff - Shock to Glee'**: Engineer the sequence to evoke initial shock/confusion, rapidly transitioning to laughter and amusement through the sheer unexpectedness of the unicorn action.",
        "**'TTS Brevity & Clarity'**: Ensure any spoken lines are extremely concise, free of complex sentence structures, and utilize simple vocabulary to guarantee crystal-clear TTS delivery that supports comedic timing rather than hindering it."

Optimizing for TTS ensures that comedic timing and clarity are preserved, even with automated narration, while distinct character voices prevent the dialogue from feeling generic.",

        "Place the primary comedic element (the unicorns) within the first 3-4 seconds, following a lightning-fast setup.",
