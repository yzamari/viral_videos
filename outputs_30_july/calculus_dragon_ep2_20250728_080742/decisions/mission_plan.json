Dragon conductor's MAGICAL TRAIN is HIJACKED by epsilon-delta BANDITS! Each train car is a sequence term RACING toward limit station while bandits throw MATHEMATICAL OBSTACLES! Dragon must FIGHT OFF convergence villains, blast through epsilon tunnels with FIRE BREATH, and use the SQUEEZE THEOREM as a WEAPON! Include train EXPLOSIONS, ridiculous chase scenes, and the dragon using bounded sequences as SHIELDS! Make students SCREAM with laughter while mastering limits!",
