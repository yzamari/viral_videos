00:00.000 --> 00:04.650
Prepare for a hilariously epic, Family
Guy-style time-travel adventure

00:04.950 --> 00:07.458
My mathematical time machine, powered by
the constant 'e', is ready

00:07.758 --> 00:10.109
Let us witness history unfold recursively

00:10.409 --> 00:14.170
Monotonic sequences are simply upwardly
mobile operators

00:14.470 --> 00:17.448
Nested intervals are my personal time
portals

00:17.748 --> 00:20.700
We will explore paradoxes and
possibilities

00:21.000 --> 00:23.273
Time itself bends to my will

00:23.573 --> 00:25.819
This journey will be unforgettable

00:26.119 --> 00:27.817
Expect the unexpected

00:28.117 --> 00:29.528
Prepare to laugh

00:29.828 --> 00:31.473
Prepare to be amazed

00:31.773 --> 00:33.341
The adventure begins now
