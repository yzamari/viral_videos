Each distinct sound effect \u2013 the CRASH, WHOOSH, BOOM, ZAP, THWACK, CRACK, WHAM \u2013 needs to be meticulously timed and punchy, acting as the backbone for rapid visual cuts. This sonic emphasis will drive the pacing, ensuring every 2-3 second action sequence lands with maximum impact within the 35-second timeframe, making it highly digestible and shareable.",
