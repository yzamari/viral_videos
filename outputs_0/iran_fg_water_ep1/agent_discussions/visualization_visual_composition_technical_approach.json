The animation will emphasize the absurdity of water 'ghosting' Iran, contrasting this with the oblivious official and the desperate citizens, all driven by a tight script and voice acting to deliver the dark humor effectively.",

The visual composition will leverage distinct cutaways to the news anchor, the animated map gag, and the oblivious official, culminating in the stark depiction of citizens licking dew to drive home the absurdity and gravity of the situation. This approach maximizes comedic impact and emotional resonance within the tight timeframe, making the core message memorable and shareable.",

We will strategically allocate time for each element: a brief intro with the Iran International logo and Maryam's exaggerated delivery, a dynamic animated map sequence showcasing the 'ghosting' water, a swift cut to the oblivious official, and a final, stark visual of citizens licking dew, all designed to land the dark humor effectively and synchronously.",
