        "Visually represent 'divergent sequences' as rockets that physically break apart or fly off-screen due to excessive force, while 'convergent sequences' could be depicted as rockets gracefully landing or docking in perfect alignment with a station segment.

        "The 'ratio test as space multiplication game' could involve the dragon rapidly multiplying objects (e.g., multiplying copies of itself or cosmic snacks) with clearly diminishing or increasing growth rates visually tied to the ratio's value. The 'root test as cosmic plant growth' can show a plant with exponential growth, its tendrils reaching out and then retracting based on the root's value, culminating in a funny overgrowth or stunted growth gag.",
        "Each convergence test demonstration should be allocated approximately 7-10 seconds maximum, including the explanation and visual gag, to ensure all elements fit within 40 seconds. The title card takes 3 seconds, leaving ~37 seconds for all content.",
        "For the 'comparison test as rocket races,' one rocket's journey could be visually mirrored or contrasted with another whose speed or trajectory is clearly superior/inferior, with the dragon providing commentary on their 'convergence' or 'divergence' based on their relative performance."

For example, the multiplication game could have rockets multiplying comically, the plant growth could have rapid, absurd growth spurts, and the rocket races should have unexpected, humorous outcomes. These visual hooks increase shareability and recall.",
