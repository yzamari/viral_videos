  "mission": "Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon conductor runs a magical number train to teach sequences and limits. Each train car represents sequence terms approaching a limit. Explain convergence, epsilon-delta definition, unique limit theorem, bounded sequences, arithmetic of limits, and the squeeze theorem. Use visual metaphors: train approaching limit station, epsilon tunnels, safety rails for bounds. Make it entertaining while teaching how sequences converge to limits with mathematical precision.",
