      "message": "To accomplish this Marvel Comics-style narrative within the Instagram platform and the target duration, we must leverage dynamic pacing, evocative sound design, and concise, impactful visuals. Each segment needs to be a punchy, self-contained beat that builds momentum, reflecting the epic and dramatic arc of the story. The audio must underscore the emotional weight of each scene, from the initial defiance to the descent into chaos and eventual grim realization.",

      "reasoning": "This approach ensures that the complex narrative, spanning political intrigue, personal turmoil, and a bleak conclusion, is delivered effectively within Instagram's typical short-form video consumption habits. By focusing on impactful sound and visuals, we can convey the story's emotional arc and persuasive message efficiently, making it memorable and driving home the 'creep' of the final message.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds per major scene to capture its essence, ensuring the 'WANTED' posters, thought bubble, Camp David summit, and peace signing each have distinct audio signatures and visual impact. The 'FLUTTER!' sound effect for the doves needs to be sharp and transitional.",
        "For the 'Lebanon War Chaos' and 'Depression Spiral' segments, employ a significant shift in audio texture and rhythm. This could involve distorted sound effects, a rapid, jarring music cue, and possibly vocalizations that mimic Thor's breakdown, culminating in the 'Nobel Prize MELTS' visual with a visceral melting sound effect.",
        "The 'Cave Hermit' scene requires a stark audio contrast \u2013 silence or a very minimalist, echoing soundscape to emphasize isolation, with the caption delivered in a deep, resonant, almost world-weary voice. The post-credit 'symbiote spreading' map needs a subtle, unnerving ambient track that gradually intensifies.",
        "The overall pacing must guide the viewer through the narrative arc: a strong, hopeful beginning, a dramatic fall, and a chilling, cautionary end. This emotional journey is key to the mission's persuasive intent."

      "concerns": [
        "The primary concern is balancing the density of the narrative with the need for clear, digestible segments on Instagram. Cramming too much visual information or too many distinct plot points into short segments could dilute the impact.",
        "Ensuring the audio perfectly syncs with the visuals, especially during the slow-motion peace signing and the rapid descent into the 'Thor-like breakdown,' will be critical for maintaining the epic feel and avoiding a jarring experience."

Each transition needs to be seamless and visually justified."
