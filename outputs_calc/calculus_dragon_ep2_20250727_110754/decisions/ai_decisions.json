A vibrant color palette will enhance the playful and engaging nature of the animation, appealing to a general audience on Instagram who are drawn to visually stimulating content.

Placing the text in the bottom center of the screen allows for good visibility of the characters and action while keeping the text accessible and easy to read for a broad audience on Instagram. This position also avoids the bottom 20% as per the rules for Instagram.",
