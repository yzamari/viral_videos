# Dragon Calculus AI Agent Guidelines

## Mission Philosophy
We're giving AI agents SHORT missions to encourage creativity while ensuring educational value.

## Old Approach (Too Prescriptive):
"Dragon Episode 1: What is a Limit - Getting Really Really Close. Dragon has 1 cookie. He eats half leaving 0.5..."
- Problem: No room for AI creativity
- AI agents just follow the script
- Less engaging and dynamic

## New Approach (Creative Freedom):
"Dragon teaches kids what a mathematical limit is using fun everyday examples"
- AI agents choose the examples
- AI agents decide the narrative
- AI agents create the visual demonstrations
- More surprising and engaging content

## What AI Agents Will Decide:

### ScriptStrategistAgent:
- Which everyday examples to use
- How to structure the lesson
- What analogies work best
- The narrative arc

### VisualDesignAgent:
- What objects to show (cookies, toys, etc.)
- Color schemes and visual style
- How to visualize abstract concepts
- Animation ideas

### AudioProductionAgent:
- Dragon's tone and excitement level
- Sound effects to enhance learning
- Music to match the mood
- Pacing of delivery

### EngagementOptimizer:
- Hook strategies
- Interactive elements
- Memorable phrases
- Call-to-action

## Guidelines for AI Agents:

1. **Target Audience**: Kids aged 7-12
2. **Language Level**: Simple, everyday words
3. **Teaching Method**: Show don't tell
4. **Episode Length**: 40 seconds
5. **Learning Goal**: One clear concept per episode
6. **Style**: Fun, exciting, memorable

## Expected AI Creativity Examples:

### For Limits Episode:
AI might choose:
- Walking toward a door with smaller steps
- Eating pizza slices getting smaller
- Zooming in on a picture infinitely
- Water drops getting tinier

### For Derivatives Episode:
AI might choose:
- Bicycle speeding up/slowing down
- Plant growing faster in sunlight
- Ice cream melting rate
- Balloon inflating speed

## Benefits of This Approach:
1. **Fresh Content**: Each generation could be different
2. **AI Collaboration**: Agents work together creatively
3. **Better Engagement**: Unexpected examples keep it interesting
4. **Natural Flow**: AI creates organic narratives
5. **Adaptive Learning**: AI adjusts to what works best

## The Balance:
- Mission: Clear WHAT to teach
- AI Agents: Creative HOW to teach it
- Result: Educational + Entertaining + Unique

This approach lets the 22-agent system truly shine!
