    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: **Engagement Hook:** Start with a classic Family Guy-style cutaway gag where the dragon detective dramatically misinterprets a simple function as a high-stakes crime scene, then transitions into the animated title card. This immediately establishes the comedic tone and intrigue., **Visual Metaphor Integration:** For the domain, have the detective declare 'No Entry!' for excluded values, like a bouncer at a club. Critical points can be 'suspects' or 'clues' the detective interrogates using derivative tests. Concavity can be visualized as the dragon's mood swings \u2013 happy (concave up) or grumpy (concave down), with inflection points being mood changes., **Viral Elements:** Incorporate recurring catchphrases for the dragon detective, like \"This function's got secrets!\" or \"Case closed, differential!\" Use popular trending audio clips subtly mixed with original comedic dialogue. Encourage viewer participation by asking \"What function should Detective Ignis tackle next?\" in the comments.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is balancing the Family Guy-style comedy with the accuracy and clarity of the calculus concepts. If the humor overshadows the educational aspect, the core purpose will be lost.",
      "Balancing Comedy and Education: Ensure the humor doesn't overshadow the educational value. The visual metaphors need to be clear enough that the underlying calculus concept remains understandable, even amidst the gags.",
      "The duration being 'Unknown Duration' is a concern; Instagram favors shorter, punchier content for Reels. We need to break down the complex function analysis into very digestible, 10-30 second segments within the overall video to maintain audience attention.",
      "Ensuring the educational content remains clear and accurate despite the comedic overlay; the humor should enhance, not obscure, the learning objectives."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Incorporate fast-paced visual jokes and sound effects in the Family Guy style to punctuate each solved step of the function analysis, making it digestible and entertaining.",
      "Utilize the 'mood swings for concavity' visual metaphor by having the dragon's personality dramatically shift (e.g., happy, angry, confused) to represent changes in concavity, creating memorable and shareable moments.",
      "Implement rapid-fire visual gags and witty dialogue that align with Family Guy's humor, assigning each calculus step (domain, critical points, etc.) as a 'clue' or 'suspect' for the Dragon Detective to investigate.",
      "**Engagement Hook:** Start with a classic Family Guy-style cutaway gag where the dragon detective dramatically misinterprets a simple function as a high-stakes crime scene, then transitions into the animated title card. This immediately establishes the comedic tone and intrigue.",
      "Visual Metaphor Integration: Dedicate specific, short segments where the dragon\u2019s exaggerated 'mood swings' directly correlate to the concavity of the function (e.g., happy dragon = concave up, grumpy dragon = concave down). Utilize quick cuts and sound effects to mimic the Family Guy humor for each step of the function analysis.",
      "Shareable Case Files: Present each calculus concept (domain, critical points, etc.) as a 'case file' the dragon is solving. Conclude with a concise, visually striking summary of the function's 'profile,' presented as the solved case, perfect for sharing.",
      "**Technical Considerations:** Ensure the animation is fluid and high-quality, especially for the title card and transitions. Maintain consistent brand visuals for the dragon character. Optimize video aspect ratio for Instagram Reels (9:16). Use clear, concise on-screen text for key terms and findings to aid comprehension even with sound off.",
      "**CTA Strategy:** After each section of analysis (domain, critical points, etc.), include a micro-CTA like \"Tap to save this method!\" or \"Share if you get it!\". For the end, a strong CTA like \"Follow for more calculus capers!\" or \"Comment your favorite function analysis technique\" will drive follows and engagement.",
      "**Visual Metaphor Integration:** For the domain, have the detective declare 'No Entry!' for excluded values, like a bouncer at a club. Critical points can be 'suspects' or 'clues' the detective interrogates using derivative tests. Concavity can be visualized as the dragon's mood swings \u2013 happy (concave up) or grumpy (concave down), with inflection points being mood changes.",

Encourage viewer participation by asking \"What function should Detective Ignis tackle next?\" in the comments.",
      "**Shareability:** Make the final sketched curve a visually satisfying reveal, perhaps with the dragon giving a thumbs-up or a triumphant roar. Short, easily digestible segments of the analysis that can be pulled out as individual reels or clips (e.g., just the domain finding) will increase shareability.",
      "Develop a distinct 'case file' visual for each calculus concept (domain, critical points, concavity, etc.) that the dragon detective needs to solve."
