The Family Guy style allows for exaggerated character expressions and quick visual gags to make the function analysis engaging.  The 3-second animated title card must establish the tone and intrigue, with subsequent segments seamlessly integrating mathematical concepts into the detective narrative.",

The 3-second animated title card must be explosive and set the comedic, investigative tone immediately, while the rest of the 37 seconds should rapidly cycle through the function analysis steps, each presented as a 'case file' being solved by the dragon detective, with distinct visual gags for concavity shifts ('mood swings').",
