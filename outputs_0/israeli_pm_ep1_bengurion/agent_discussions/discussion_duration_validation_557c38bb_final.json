    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds per major action panel (e.g., Ben-Gurion bursting, Mandate vanishing, independence declaration) to allow for visual impact and primary sound effects (BOOM, SNAP, KA-POW). The montage and tech panels can be quicker, around 3-5 seconds each, to maintain momentum., Utilize distinct, high-impact sound effects for each comic panel action (e.g., 'BOOM' for explosion, 'SNAP' for the vanishing, 'KA-POW' for declaration, 'WHOOSH' for movement) and integrate voiceover snippets ('I am... INEVITABLE!', 'Finally, peace.') to align with the visuals and enhance the comic-book aesthetic. Ensure the final teaser and editor's note are delivered with a confident, authoritative tone., Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds per key visual sequence (e.g., Ben-Gurion emerging, mandate vanishing, action montage) to allow for impactful animation and sound design, ensuring the entire narrative arc fits within the 65-second target.",
