Follow with a swift transition to whimsical Ghibli sounds and a gentle, warm voice for Grandma, around 6-7 seconds. The 'reality check' should have a sudden, comical deflation of sound, lasting about 3 seconds. The night scene needs to explode with energetic party music and clear, crisp sound for the dialogue, especially the drunk guy's line, which should be timed for maximum comedic effect, about 12-15 seconds., The catchiest Hebrew slogan should be delivered with confidence and a slight echo effect, and the business information needs clear, concise audio delivery at the very end, perhaps with a quick sting., Allocate approximately 4-6 seconds for the Marvel-style hero entrance and transformation sequence to build hype.",

The 'reality check' needs a swift sonic deflation, like a cartoon 'bonk' or deflating balloon.  The night scene should explode with an upbeat, trending pop track with clear, crisp dialogue for the partygoers and the drunk guy.",
        "The drunk guy's line at 2 am should be delivered with a slightly slurred but still comprehensible, comedic tone, emphasizing the absurdity of ordering a 'healthy' shake. The final Hebrew slogan needs a punchy, memorable musical sting, possibly a short jingle, to drive it home.
