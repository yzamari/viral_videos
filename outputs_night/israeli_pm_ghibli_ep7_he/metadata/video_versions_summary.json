  "mission": "Studio Ghibli magic! Yitzhak Shamir, the underground fighter turned Prime Minister, emerges from Jerusalem's ancient stone walls like a guardian spirit. Small in stature but mighty in spirit, he stands firm as mystical winds of change blow around him. Underground tunnels glow with memories of his Lehi days as he transforms from shadow warrior to nation leader. His piercing eyes see through diplomatic illusions. Stone tablets of Jewish history float around him as he declares 'The sea is the same sea, the Arabs are the same Arabs.' Dramatic music of unwavering determination.",
