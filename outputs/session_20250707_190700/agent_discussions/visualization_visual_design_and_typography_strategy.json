Our typography should be instantly legible for a rapid-fire 30-second YouTube format, while subtly enhancing the humorous irony or punchline delivery through its style and placement.",

Typography must reflect this duality, using clear, authoritative fonts for informational elements while employing playful or ironically 'innocent' styles for comedic punchlines or absurd details to maximize impact within the tight 30-second format.",

The text itself should actively participate in the humor, not merely convey information.",
