    "reasoning": "For Instagram, the 'bottom_center' position is generally safe and allows for good visibility of the content without obstructing the main visual elements. It avoids the bottom 20% as per the rules and is a common area for text overlays in short-form video content.",

Cover epsilon-delta definition, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity conditions, types of discontinuities, and the intermediate value theorem. Use visual metaphors: smooth flying vs teleporting, landing from different directions, altitude changes. Make limits and continuity intuitive through flight analogies.",
