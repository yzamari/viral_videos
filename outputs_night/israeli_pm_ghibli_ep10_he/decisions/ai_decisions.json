    "reasoning": "The prompt explicitly mentions 'Studio Ghibli magic!' and describes fantastical elements like high-tech flowers, birds carrying ideas, and bridges of light, which are perfectly captured by the anime style. The 'vibrant' color palette aligns with the 'colorful birds' and the overall optimistic and magical tone. This style is highly popular and engaging on TikTok, particularly with the specified audience who will appreciate the imaginative and hopeful visual storytelling.",

    "reasoning": "For TikTok, the bottom_left position is chosen to keep the overlay out of the center and to avoid potential obstruction from UI elements that might appear in the bottom right or bottom center during playback. This provides good visibility without interfering with the main visual elements.",

His dreams manifest as colorful birds carrying startup ideas across the sky. With gentle smile and wise eyes, he builds bridges of light between old and new Israel. The Dimona reactor glows with peaceful atomic energy as he whispers secrets to the wind. In his magical workshop, peace agreements transform into origami cranes. At 90, he still dreams of tomorrow, teaching robots to dance the hora. Inspiring music of eternal optimism.",
