For example, the 'Juggernaut' entrance would feature heavy, percussive sound design and a booming voiceover., Utilize rapid cuts, evocative imagery (stock footage or animations) representing the 'Mysterio illusions' and 'Thanos Reality Stone' moments, and distinct audio cues for each character/event to maintain audience engagement and comprehension within the tight timeframe., Allocate approximately 7-8 seconds per segment, allowing for rapid visual storytelling and brief narration. For the 'Juggernaut' entry, use imposing visuals and a commanding voiceover, immediately establishing his persona.

The Second Intifada segment should feature fast-paced, aggressive editing and a 'Punisher' voiceover to convey a relentless, decisive approach.
