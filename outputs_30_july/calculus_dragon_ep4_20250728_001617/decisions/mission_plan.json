Teach monotonic convergence theorem, recursive sequences, the number e, nested intervals, subsequences, and Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Use visual metaphors: climbing/descending stairs, time loops for recursion, shrinking boxes for nested intervals. Make it funny while explaining how bounded monotonic sequences must converge.",
