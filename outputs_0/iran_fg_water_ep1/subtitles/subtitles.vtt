00:00.000 --> 00:01.995
Welcome back to Iran International News.

00:01.995 --> 00:02.328
I

00:02.328 --> 00:03.357
am your anchor, Maryam.

00:03.357 --> 00:04.128
We have breaking

00:04.128 --> 00:04.320
news:

00:04.320 --> 00:05.472
Scientists confirm water has vanished from

00:05.472 --> 00:05.887
Iran.

00:05.887 --> 00:07.961
It is a complete disappearance.

00:07.961 --> 00:08.376
We

00:08.376 --> 00:09.864
now go to a government official for

00:09.864 --> 00:10.231
comment.

00:10.231 --> 00:12.432
Sir, what is your response to

00:12.432 --> 00:13.646
this water crisis?

00:13.646 --> 00:14.050
Water?

00:14.050 --> 00:15.264
I have not

00:15.264 --> 00:15.562
heard of her.

00:15.562 --> 00:15.861
Is she single?

00:15.861 --> 00:15.960
Meanwhile,

00:15.960 --> 00:17.376
desperate citizens are seen collecting
morning dew

00:17.376 --> 00:17.787
from car surfaces.

00:17.787 --> 00:18.336
A truly resourceful, yet

00:18.336 --> 00:23.112
heartbreaking, situation unfolds as this
unexpected crisis

00:23.112 --> 00:23.911
deepens.

00:23.911 --> 00:28.704
The lack of water impacts agriculture,

00:28.704 --> 00:32.839
daily life, and threatens public health.

00:32.839 --> 00:33.528
Experts

00:33.528 --> 00:38.232
warn of a severe humanitarian crisis
unless

00:38.232 --> 00:40.659
immediate action is taken.

00:40.659 --> 00:42.480
International aid organizations

00:42.480 --> 00:44.794
are preparing emergency relief packages.

00:44.794 --> 00:45.720
The government

00:45.720 --> 00:49.320
is under immense pressure to provide
solutions.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.416
Citizens are organizing protests,
demanding answers and

00:52.416 --> 00:52.906
action.

00:52.906 --> 00:55.848
The situation is dire, and the

00:55.848 --> 00:57.411
future remains uncertain.

00:57.411 --> 00:59.496
The government's nonchalant response

00:59.496 --> 00:59.921
is adding to public outrage.

00:59.921 --> 01:00.857
We will continue to provide updates as
this critical situation evolves.

01:00.857 --> 01:01.368
Please stay tuned for further
developments.
