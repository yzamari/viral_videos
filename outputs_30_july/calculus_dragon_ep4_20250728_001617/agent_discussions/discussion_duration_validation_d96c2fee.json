      "suggestions": [
        "Segment the script into very short, punchy bursts, each no more than two sentences, with distinct visual actions for the dragon. For instance, a climb up stairs could be a struggle, a descent a triumph, with Peter Griffin-esque commentary.",
        "Incorporate 'sound gags' \u2013 like a 'boing' sound when a recursive sequence jumps back, or a sigh of relief when a monotonic sequence finally converges. This leverages the audio-centric expertise for maximum comedic impact and synchronicity."

Over-simplification could lead to inaccuracy, while too much detail will lose viewers."

      "reasoning": "The success hinges on balancing humor and education. Family Guy's humor often comes from characters reacting to absurd situations, which is perfect for a baby dragon grappling with advanced math. For Instagram, this means extremely rapid pacing and strong visual gags to keep viewers hooked.",
      "suggestions": [
        "For monotonic sequences on infinite stairs, have the dragon excitedly climb, only to find the stairs just keep going, leading to exasperated squawks. Then, show it cautiously descending, establishing boundedness with increasing frustration.",
        "Implement time loops for recursion using a 'Groundhog Day' style visual where the dragon repeats a simple, frustrating action (like trying to reach a toy) over and over, until it finds a 'recursive solution' \u2013 perhaps a shortcut, much to its surprise.",
        "Represent the number 'e' by having the dragon constantly trying to blow a bubble that grows exponentially, but always pops just before it gets too big, illustrating continuous growth.",
        "Use shrinking boxes for nested intervals, with the dragon trying to contain something within progressively smaller boxes, getting increasingly cramped and annoyed.",
        "Subsequences can be shown by the dragon picking out specific favorite snacks from a scattered pile, ignoring others, symbolizing selecting elements.",
        "Bolzano-Weierstrass can be visualized with the dragon getting lost in a maze of identical rooms, but each room has a unique pattern on the wall, showing it's bounded within the maze but can find distinct states."

      "concerns": [
        "The primary concern is cramming all these advanced mathematical concepts (monotonic sequences, recursive sequences, 'e', nested intervals, subsequences, Bolzano-Weierstrass) into a short, digestible format without sacrificing humor or clarity. The 'Unknown Duration' aspect needs to be managed very tightly to fit Instagram's best practices for retention, likely aiming for the shorter end of the \u00b15% tolerance."
