Train approaches station L. 'Convergence means getting closer!' Epsilon tunnel - we get within \u03b5 of L! Unique limit theorem: 'Only ONE destination!' Bounded sequences stay on track. Arithmetic of limits: 'Add, multiply, it all works!' Sandwich theorem: Dragon sandwich with sequences! Epsilon chicks form convergent sequence!",

The train approaches station L. Convergence means getting closer and closer. Through the Epsilon tunnel, we get within epsilon of L! That is quite a feat. The unique limit theorem states there is only one destination. No detours allowed! Bounded sequences stay on track, never going too far off. They are reliable travelers. The arithmetic of limits: Add, multiply, it all works perfectly. Mathematical magic! Behold, the Sandwich theorem: Dragon sandwich with sequences! Epsilon chicks form a convergent sequence!",
    "final_script": "All aboard the Sequence Express! Each car represents a , a\u2082, a\u2083\u2026 CHOO CHOO! We are headed to the limit. This train journey approaches station L. Convergence means approaching closer and closer. The Epsilon tunnel brings us within epsilon of L. What a feat! The unique limit theorem guarantees only one destination. No detours are permitted. Bounded sequences remain on track, never straying too far. They are dependable travelers. The arithmetic of limits functions , multiplication, all work perfectly. It is mathematical magic! The Sandwich theorem is a delightful delicious sequence sandwich! Even epsilon chicks converge beautifully",
