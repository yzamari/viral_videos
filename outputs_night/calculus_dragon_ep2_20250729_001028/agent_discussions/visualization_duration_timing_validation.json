The 3-second animated title card is crucial for immediate engagement, and we must then pack the educational content and gags efficiently to meet the 40-second target without sacrificing clarity or humor. The key is a tight edit that makes every second count, leveraging the visual metaphor of the train for sequence concepts.",
