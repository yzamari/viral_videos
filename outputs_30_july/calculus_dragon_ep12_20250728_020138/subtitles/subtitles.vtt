00:00.000 --> 00:03.315
Behold, young one, the blurry future of
this function!

00:03.315 --> 00:03.683
We

00:03.983 --> 00:08.189
approximate it with a simple line, like a
predictable prediction.

00:08.489 --> 00:13.374
Then, a touch more magic, a quadratic
curve, bringing clarity

00:13.674 --> 00:14.110
closer.

00:14.110 --> 00:18.036
Each term, a shrinking error, a purer
glimpse of

00:18.336 --> 00:19.475
truth revealed.

00:19.475 --> 00:24.031
Infinite terms, a perfect prediction, the
true infinite

00:24.331 --> 00:25.367
magic of series unfolds.

00:25.367 --> 00:27.440
Behold, young one, the blurry future of
