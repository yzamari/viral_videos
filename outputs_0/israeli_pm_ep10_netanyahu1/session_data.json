Mr. Security glows with an inner power. Behold, the chest beam of influence! Narrow victory! Just one percent separates me from my opponent. The people have spoken.

The coalition has collapsed. My heroic allies have scattered. Disbanding the ranks now. I will be back. I will practice in mirrors. One day, I will be the longest serving leader.",

A narrow victory, just one percent separated me from my opponent. The people have spoken. The Western Wall tunnel opening unleashed chaos. Spirits escaped, dissolving peace.  Cigars and champagne flowed; a celebratory atmosphere filled the air.  Sara, however, entered a furious rage.  She unleashed her anger upon my political foes. The coalition unexpectedly collapsed. My heroic allies scattered. I disbanded the ranks. I will return, stronger and more determined.  I will practice in mirrors, honing my image. One day, I will be the longest-serving leader. My vision for Israel is clear, unwavering, and powerful. I will not be deterred. I will prevail.",
