00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,906
Welcome, treasure hunters!

2
00:00:02,206 --> 00:00:05,550
Today, we hunt dragon gold and learn about
math.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,134
To find the most treasure, we must check
the endpoints of our quest.

4
00:00:10,434 --> 00:00:13,229
This is the Extreme Value Theorem in
action.

5
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:16,377
Smooth, continuous dragon flights are
essential;

6
00:00:16,677 --> 00:00:18,505
jerky flights are not.

7
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:21,809
Our dragon must fly without sudden stops.

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,255
The dragon's speed at any moment is its
derivative, the instantaneous rate of

9
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:31,944
If its path allows a tangent line, it
is differentiable and continuous.

10
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:35,222
Finding treasure is like following a
predictable path
