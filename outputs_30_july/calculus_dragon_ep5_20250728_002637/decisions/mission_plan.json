Explain the fundamental theorem that Cauchy equals convergent in real numbers, upper and lower limits, Heine-Borel theorem for compactness, Dedekind cuts, and Cauchy completion. Use visual metaphors: dragon formations, flight records, covering with blankets. Make it entertaining while explaining completeness of real numbers.",
