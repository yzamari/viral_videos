1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,201
Surprise!

2
00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:01,008
A Prime Minister's panel

3
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:01,435
convened.

4
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:03,144
Olmert declared, "I did

5
00:00:03,144 --> 00:00:04,775
not ask for this!

6
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:05,592
" It

7
00:00:05,592 --> 00:00:08,280
felt like a sudden, venomous

8
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,537
spider bite.

9
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:11,424
The Lebanon War

10
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:12,441
spawned two investigative panels;

11
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:12,696
an

12
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:13,550
immediate attack.

13
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,832
Everything crumbled spectacularly.

14
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:18,719
The Winograd investigation resembled a

15
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,174
relentless SHIELD interrogation.

16
00:00:20,174 --> 00:00:21,143
Secret negotiations

17
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:22,199
offered Jerusalem.

18
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,783
They even suggested,

19
00:00:23,783 --> 00:00:25,303
"Take the Infinity Gauntlet!

20
00:00:25,303 --> 00:00:26,064
" Imagine

21
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:28,943
wielding that immense power.

22
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:29,664
Corruption

23
00:00:29,664 --> 00:00:33,408
panels revealed a Hydra-like proliferation

24
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,079
of wrongdoing.

25
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,088
Cash envelopes rained

26
00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:39,072
down, a torrential storm of

27
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:39,532
illicit funds.

28
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:40,224
Then came the

29
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:41,001
prison sentence.

30
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:42,168
The removal of

31
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:43,800
his power, like stripping Iron

32
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,464
Man of his armor, began

33
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:47,875
with a clang.

34
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:48,816
Prison stripes.

35
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:50,016
The first Prime Minister imprisoned.

36
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:50,326
A hollow cell echo resonated.

37
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:50,700
He reflected, "I almost achieved peace.

38
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,073
" A memoir's poignant thought bubble:

39
00:00:51,073 --> 00:00:51,321
"If only they knew...

40
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:51,384
"
