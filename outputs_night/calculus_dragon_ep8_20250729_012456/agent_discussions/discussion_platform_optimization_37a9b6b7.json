The Family Guy style comedy is key for engagement, ensuring the humor lands while making abstract ideas accessible, particularly with the proposed visual metaphors.  Optimizing for early retention with the animated title card and leveraging Instagram's interactive features will be crucial.",

        "Utilize Instagram Reels for maximum discoverability and engagement; ensure the video is vertical and captures attention within the first 3 seconds, building on the animated title card's impact with rapid-fire visual gags and clear, concise explanations.",
        "Integrate interactive elements like polls or Q&A stickers within the video's Instagram Story or post description to encourage user participation and further solidify understanding of the 'dragon flight' analogies for limits and continuity.",
        "Design a highly engaging thumbnail that teases the comedic and visual elements, perhaps a freeze-frame of the dragon mid-flight with a humorous expression, and use relevant hashtags like #CalculusForPilots, #DragonMath, #FamilyGuyMath, #LimitsAndContinuity, and #Edutainment.",
        "Prioritize sound design and voice acting to deliver the Family Guy-style humor and clear explanations effectively; ensure subtitles are perfectly synced to the natural speech breaks for optimal readability on mute, a common Instagram viewing habit."

        "Utilize 'teleporting' as a visual for a function without limits, contrasting it with the dragon's smooth, continuous flight path to explain continuity. Show the dragon smoothly adjusting altitude (vertical limits) and direction (horizontal limits) to illustrate one-sided limits and approaching a specific point.",
        "For discontinuities, show the dragon encountering 'turbulence' (removable discontinuity) or 'hitting a wall' (jump discontinuity) in its flight path, with the pilot comically trying to explain why the smooth flight is interrupted.",
