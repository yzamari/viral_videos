    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For the Marvel-style hero entrance, use a dramatic, impactful sound effect combined with a slight echo on the 'crash.' For the Ghibli transformation, layer in gentle, shimmering chimes and subtle nature sounds, with Grandma's voice being warm and slightly ethereal. The 'reality check' needs a swift sonic deflation, like a cartoon 'bonk' or deflating balloon.  The night scene should explode with an upbeat, trending pop track with clear, crisp dialogue for the partygoers and the drunk guy., The drunk guy's line at 2 am should be delivered with a slightly slurred but still comprehensible, comedic tone, emphasizing the absurdity of ordering a 'healthy' shake. The final Hebrew slogan needs a punchy, memorable musical sting, possibly a short jingle, to drive it home.  Ensure the business information is clear and brief at the very end, with a quick, recognizable sound effect., For the 'hero entrance,' use a heavy, dramatic sting that cuts abruptly to a light, magical Ghibli-esque soundscape for the transformation. The 'reality check' should be accompanied by a comedic 'deflating' sound effect.",
