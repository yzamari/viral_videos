          "message": "To strategically accomplish this epic Marvel Comics narrative on Instagram within 65 seconds, we will leverage a dramatic audio-visual escalation, mirroring a comic book's pacing and emotional impact. The audio will transition from an anthemic, defiant opening with a strong voiceover for the 'WANTED' posters to a chaotic, distorted soundscape for the 'Lebanon War' and 'Depression Spiral' sections, culminating in a chilling, minimalist audio for the final 'symbiote' spread. This approach emphasizes emotional journey and synchronization.",

          "message": "To accomplish this epic Marvel Comics narrative on Instagram within 65 seconds, we'll employ a high-impact, emotionally resonant audio strategy that mirrors the visual escalation. A powerful, deep voiceover will deliver the initial defiance and hope, transitioning to more fragmented, intense vocalizations and sound effects during the 'Lebanon War Chaos' and 'Depression Spiral' segments to convey internal turmoil and loss of control. The 'Cave Hermit' section will feature a stark, resonant voice carrying the heavy caption, followed by a subtle, unsettling ambient track for the post-credit map to cement the cautionary message.",

          "message": "To strategically accomplish the 'Marvel Comics epic' narrative within 65 seconds on Instagram, we must synchronize a powerful, deep voiceover with dynamically evolving sound design. This involves a clear vocal progression from assertive defiance to a fractured, desperate tone, underscored by escalating sound chaos and a stark, unnerving ambient outro. The goal is to emotionally guide the viewer through the rise, fall, and cautionary aftermath, ensuring each audio cue reinforces the visual narrative for maximum impact and persuasion.",
