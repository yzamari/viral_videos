The opening Ant-Man-style materialization needs to be punchy (3-4 seconds), followed by the overshadowed montage and inner monologue (25-30 seconds). The Doctor Strange-esque diplomatic skills segment will require a similar time investment (20-25 seconds), leading into the Ben-Gurion shadow reveal (5-7 seconds). Finally, the post-credit scene with Stan Lee needs to be brief and impactful (5-7 seconds).",
