    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Implement a 'panel progression' visual style: Each segment will be framed as a distinct comic panel, with sharp cuts and dramatic zooms. Utilize specific Marvel character styles (Ant-Man shrinking, Loki switching sides, Silver Surfer surfing, Doctor Strange's magic) to instantly convey the essence of each event and enhance comedic/dramatic effect., Craft a punchy, rhythmic voiceover: The narration will be delivered with a cadence that mimics comic book captions and sound effects, ensuring each line is delivered within 2-3 seconds. This tight timing will also incorporate distinct sound cues (shrink, swoosh, poof, evil laugh) to amplify the narrative beats and maintain audience attention throughout the rapid sequence of events., Allocate an average of 7-8 seconds per segment to ensure all 8 distinct points are hit with visual and auditory punch, allowing for sharp transitions and impactful meme moments.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is ensuring each of the 8 distinct narrative 'panels' is conveyed with sufficient clarity and comedic or dramatic punch within its allotted 7-8 seconds. Overcrowding the visuals or dialogue in any segment could dilute the message and lead to viewer disengagement, potentially causing the content to feel rushed or incomprehensible.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring each segment is concise enough to land its intended comedic or political punch without feeling rushed or losing clarity. The rapid succession of distinct events requires meticulous timing and efficient visual storytelling to avoid overwhelming the viewer.",
      "The primary concern is fitting all the distinct narrative points (Ant-Man, betrayal, coalition, Yamina, COVID, Putin, Iran, collapse, tech vanish, post-credit) into the 65-second timeframe without feeling rushed or losing the intended satirical impact. Each 'panel' must land its point quickly and effectively, requiring extremely tight editing and voiceover pacing."

      "Implement a dynamic soundscape with distinct Marvel-esque sound effects for each 'panel' transition. For instance, a 'shrink' sound for Ant-Man, a 'glitch' or 'rewind' for the Loki-style side switch, a dramatic 'dissolve' for Yamina, and a powerful 'WHOOSH' for Silver Surfer. These audio cues will be paramount in reinforcing visual cues and maintaining momentum.",

      "Employ a distinct visual style for each 'panel' that mirrors the intended Marvel inspiration (e.g., Ant-Man's shrinking effect, Loki's iconic pose for betrayal, Doctor Strange's magic for despair) to enhance immediate recognition and thematic cohesion."
