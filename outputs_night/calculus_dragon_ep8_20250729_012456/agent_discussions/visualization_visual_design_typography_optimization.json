The humor and visual metaphors will be key to making abstract ideas accessible and shareable.",

          "message": "For the 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' title card, prioritizing a bold, legible font like 'Impact' or a stylized, slightly condensed sans-serif that evokes motion and excitement is crucial. The animation should clearly convey 'Smooth Dragon Flights' with trailing smoke or fiery trails, ensuring the text is readable for the full 3 seconds against dynamic effects.  For the educational content, the visual design must maintain a clear hierarchy of information, using distinct typographic styles for dialogue, theorem names, and visual cues to guide the viewer through the complex concepts.",

          "message": "For 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!', the title card needs a vibrant, almost explosive color palette \u2013 think fiery oranges and deep, regal purples \u2013 with dynamic motion that mimics a dragon's powerful yet controlled ascent to instantly capture the Instagram audience's attention. The core of the video must leverage the comedic narrative to make abstract calculus concepts like epsilon-delta and continuity relatable through flight analogies, ensuring the humor enhances, not distracts from, the educational value to maximize engagement and shareability within the short format.",

          "message": "For 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!', the title card needs to explode with energy using vibrant, contrasting colors like fiery orange and deep purple, with bold, motion-blurring typography that screams 'epic'. The 40-second duration demands rapid-fire visual gags and clear, punchy explanations of calculus concepts using dragon flight analogies \u2013 think smooth flight paths for continuity versus jerky teleportation for discontinuities. We must leverage the Family Guy style to make the educational content inherently shareable and humorous.",
