00:00.000 --> 00:01.907
Welcome, treasure hunters!

00:02.207 --> 00:05.551
Today, we hunt dragon gold and learn about
math.

00:05.851 --> 00:10.135
To find the most treasure, we must check
the endpoints of our quest.

00:10.435 --> 00:13.230
This is the Extreme Value Theorem in
action.

00:13.530 --> 00:16.377
Smooth, continuous dragon flights are
essential;

00:16.677 --> 00:18.506
jerky flights are not.

00:18.806 --> 00:21.810
Our dragon must fly without sudden stops.

00:22.110 --> 00:27.256
The dragon's speed at any moment is its
derivative, the instantaneous rate of

00:27.556 --> 00:31.944
If its path allows a tangent line, it
is differentiable and continuous.

00:32.244 --> 00:35.222
Finding treasure is like following a
predictable path
