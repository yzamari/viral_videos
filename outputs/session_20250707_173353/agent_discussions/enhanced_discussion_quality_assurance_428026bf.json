      "message": "For a comedy video, technical quality is critical to maintain viewer engagement and ensure the humor lands effectively. We must prioritize crystal-clear audio, sharp visuals, and smooth playback to prevent any technical issues from detracting from the comedic experience. A robust quality assurance process will ensure the final product meets high professional standards.",

        "**Quality Standards & Technical Requirements:** Implement a strict checklist for 1080p minimum resolution, normalized audio levels (LKFS target), consistent 24/30fps frame rates, and artifact-free compression for YouTube upload.",
        "**User Experience Optimization:** Conduct pre-release testing on various devices and network conditions to identify and mitigate any streaming or playback issues. Ensure intuitive titling, engaging thumbnails, and clear calls to action (if any).",
        "**Accessibility Considerations:** Mandate accurate closed captions (CC) for all dialogue and critical sound effects. Evaluate the need for audio descriptions if visual gags are central to the humor and not adequately conveyed through dialogue.",
        "**Performance Optimization:** Verify optimal video encoding settings (e.g., H.264, appropriate bitrate for resolution/framerate) to ensure efficient file size for quick loading and smooth streaming on YouTube across diverse internet speeds.",
        "**Final Approval Criteria:** Require a multi-stage review process involving technical QA, content review, and a 'fresh eyes' pass by non-production personnel to catch subtle issues and validate overall user satisfaction before final upload."

From an audience perspective, however, we must meticulously optimize comedic timing, visual gags, and character clarity to ensure the humor lands effectively and maintains engagement throughout the 10-minute duration. User satisfaction is intrinsically linked to how well the comedy resonates with them.",
