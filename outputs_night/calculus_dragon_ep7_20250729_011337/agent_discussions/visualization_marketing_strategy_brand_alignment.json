          "message": "To maximize engagement for 'EPISODE 7: Function Dragon Transform!!' on Instagram, the core strategy should focus on rapid-fire visual gags within the Family Guy style to explain each function concept. The animated title card sets an immediate tone, but subsequent segment pacing is crucial. Each function explanation needs a distinct, comical dragon transformation tied to its definition and a relatable visual metaphor to ensure memorability and shareability, especially for abstract concepts like domain and range.  The goal is to make learning functions as entertaining as watching a sketch.",

The Family Guy style demands rapid-fire jokes and relatable scenarios, making the 'dragon transformation machine' and 'territory maps' critical for visualizing domain/range and one-to-one/onto functions. Focusing on these elements will make the content highly shareable and memorable for a general audience.",
