          "message": "To maximize engagement for this 'Marvel Comics explosion!' narrative on Instagram, the visual strategy must be hyper-dynamic and lean into the over-the-top comic book aesthetic, using rapid cuts, exaggerated sound effects, and distinct visual treatments for each action beat.  This approach ensures the dense content is digestible within the 55-second timeframe and capitalizes on the platform's short-form video trends for viral potential.",

          "message": "For this specific 'Marvel Comics explosion!' concept on Instagram, the visual composition needs to be a rapid-fire montage of high-impact, stylized comic panels. Each described action should be a distinct, quick cut, emphasizing the onomatopoeia with bold, animated text overlays and punchy sound design to maintain a relentless pace within the 55-second duration.",

          "message": "For this 'Marvel Comics explosion!' video, the audio-visual sync is paramount to capture the dynamic, comic-book energy. Each onomatopoeic sound effect ('CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', etc.) must be precisely matched with its corresponding visual action, reinforcing the over-the-top, exaggerated style. The voiceover lines, especially 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!', should be delivered with a strong, resonant tone that aligns with the visual of Netanyahu and the overall dramatic flair.",
