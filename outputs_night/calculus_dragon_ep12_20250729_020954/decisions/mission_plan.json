Create a Family Guy style comedy where fortune teller dragon teaches Taylor polynomials and series. Cover linear and quadratic approximations, Taylor's theorem, remainder estimates, famous series for exponential, trigonometric and logarithmic functions, and the proof that e is irrational. Use visual metaphors: crystal ball predictions, increasing precision, shrinking errors. Make power series accessible and magical.",

It's crucial to attribute these foundational mathematical concepts to their origins or standard textbooks/theories.

However, the choice of a 'fortune teller dragon' as a teacher could introduce biases related to mysticism or supernatural explanations, which might conflict with the scientific nature of the math being taught. This potential for conflicting messaging needs consideration. A disclaimer about the comedic nature and its potential to simplify or reframe complex topics could be beneficial.",

The prompt does not detail *how* these metaphors will be implemented, so method transparency is currently low."
