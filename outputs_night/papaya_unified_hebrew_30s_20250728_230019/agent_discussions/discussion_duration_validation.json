    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Segment the audio for the 'hero entrance' to be dramatic and impactful, perhaps 4-5 seconds. Follow with a swift transition to whimsical Ghibli sounds and a gentle, warm voice for Grandma, around 6-7 seconds. The 'reality check' should have a sudden, comical deflation of sound, lasting about 3 seconds. The night scene needs to explode with energetic party music and clear, crisp sound for the dialogue, especially the drunk guy's line, which should be timed for maximum comedic effect, about 12-15 seconds., The catchiest Hebrew slogan should be delivered with confidence and a slight echo effect, and the business information needs clear, concise audio delivery at the very end, perhaps with a quick sting., Allocate approximately 4-6 seconds for the Marvel-style hero entrance and transformation sequence to build hype.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The biggest concern is fitting the numerous stylistic shifts (Marvel, Ghibli, reality, party) and narrative beats (hero, grandma, drunk guy) into a precise 32-second window without feeling rushed or cluttered. Each transition needs to be smooth yet impactful.",
      "Ensuring the visual transitions are seamless and not jarring, especially between the Ghibli and reality cuts, is critical to maintaining the comedic flow.  The shift needs to be fast but understandable.",
      "The main concern is ensuring seamless audio transitions between the distinct stylistic shifts (Marvel, Ghibli, reality, party). Poorly executed audio transitions will break the immersion and comedic timing. Also, ensuring the drunk guy's dialogue at 2 am is both understandable and funny without being overly slurred is key for the 'hilarious' aspect."

      "To make this Papaya Bar TikTok ad hilarious and engaging, we need to lean heavily into dynamic audio shifts that mirror the visual transformations, emphasizing the contrast between the epic hero intro and the mundane reality, culminating in a high-energy party scene. The audio should transition from dramatic superhero sound effects to whimsical Ghibli-esque chimes, a comforting grandma's voice, and finally to upbeat party music.  For a 32-second TikTok, rapid cuts and punchy audio cues are crucial, with a word count limit of around 89 words to maintain a brisk pace.",
