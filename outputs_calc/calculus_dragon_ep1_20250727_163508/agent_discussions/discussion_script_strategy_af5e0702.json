        "The sheer volume of concepts (Natural Numbers, Zero, Integers, Rationals, Irrationals, Real Line, Absolute Value, Intervals, Bounded Sets, Supremum, Epsilon-delta) needs extremely concise scripting and rapid, clear visual representation within 63 seconds. The later concepts, particularly the supremum and epsilon-delta, are the most challenging to explain briefly while maintaining clarity and the comedic tone."
