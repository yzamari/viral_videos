The 3-second animated title card needs to be incredibly dynamic, blending the absurdity of the concept with impactful motion graphics that scream 'epic'. Given the 35-second Instagram format, every moment must be visually dense and humorously driven to maintain viewer engagement while teaching limits.",

The 3-second title card needs to be a burst of chaotic energy, using bold colors and exaggerated motion to convey the 'epic effects' and set the absurd tone. For the entire 35-second piece, maintaining this high-octane, humorous visual narrative with clear, concise on-screen text will be key to keeping viewers hooked and absorbing the limit concepts.",
