    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For each 'panel,' utilize distinct visual metaphors directly inspired by Marvel characters and storylines (e.g., Ant-Man shrinking effect, Loki's portal for the side switch, Doctor Strange's astral projection for despair, Silver Surfer's cosmic power for COVID waves). This ensures immediate thematic resonance and visual impact., Implement precise audio cues and quick sound effects for each transition to enhance the comic-book panel feel and reinforce the narrative beats, ensuring a punchy, engaging rhythm that guides the viewer through the rapid sequence of events., Assign a unique, instantly recognizable Marvel visual motif to each 'panel' (e.g., Ant-Man's size-changing for Bennett, Loki's distinct visual duality for betrayal, Doctor Strange's portal/mirror dimension for despair) to enhance visual storytelling and comic book authenticity.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is ensuring the rapid pace doesn't sacrifice clarity or the impact of the specific political commentary within each segment. Overly complex visuals or too much text could dilute the message, making it difficult for viewers to grasp the intended critique quickly.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring each of the 8 distinct narrative points, from Ant-Man shrinking to Bibi's evil laugh, lands effectively within their allocated ~7-8 seconds without feeling rushed or losing clarity. Overlapping visual or audio elements could dilute the impact of individual comedic or dramatic beats.",
      "The primary concern is maintaining clarity and narrative coherence across eight distinct, rapidly presented 'panels' within the 65-second limit. Overly complex visuals or dense dialogue could lead to viewer confusion and reduce the intended impact of each segment. We must ensure each 'panel' is instantly understandable and contributes to the overall message.",
      "Maintaining a consistent, high-quality Marvel visual style across all segments while differentiating each event will be crucial. If the styles clash or appear amateurish, it could undermine the overall message and persuasive power.",
      "Ensuring the visual style consistently evokes the intended Marvel comic book aesthetic without becoming repetitive or losing the sharp commentary is a technical challenge. The AI must balance stylistic fidelity with the need for clear representation of each specific political/social commentary point."

      "Employ a 'split-screen' or 'comic panel' layout throughout, transitioning between distinct visual segments with sharp cuts and impactful sound design (e.g., 'shrink' SFX, 'glitch' SFX for side-switching, 'Whoosh' for Silver Surfer) to maintain the comic book feel and keep pacing brisk.",
      "Assign a unique, instantly recognizable Marvel visual motif to each 'panel' (e.g., Ant-Man's size-changing for Bennett, Loki's distinct visual duality for betrayal, Doctor Strange's portal/mirror dimension for despair) to enhance visual storytelling and comic book authenticity."
