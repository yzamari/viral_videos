      "message": "For this 'Family Guy' style space comedy about convergence tests, Instagram's algorithm thrives on short, punchy, visually dynamic content. Leverage the animated title card to immediately hook viewers, and ensure each math demonstration is a quick, humorous visual gag. The 'unknown duration' allows for flexibility, but breaking down each test into 15-30 second segments with clear subtitles will maximize watch time and engagement.",
