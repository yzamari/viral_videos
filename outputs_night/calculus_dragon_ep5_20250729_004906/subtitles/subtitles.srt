1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Welcome to synchronized swimming, Cauchy
Dragons!

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,968
Maintain epsilon distance, team.

3
00:00:06,268 --> 00:00:09,168
The Heine-Borel theorem ensures our
boundaries.

4
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,819
Dedekind cuts guide our dives.

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,921
Precision is paramount;

6
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:16,285
consequences await errors.

7
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:18,387
Completeness is essential.

8
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:21,352
Each movement must refine our performance.

9
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:23,715
This is mathematical teamwork;

10
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:25,322
we are united.

11
00:00:25,622 --> 00:00:27,920
Our synchronicity is our strength.

12
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,624
We strive for flawless execution.

13
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:33,797
Success depends on our collective
precision.

14
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:36,526
We will achieve perfection together.

15
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:38,786
Our unity is our power.

16
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:42,246
This performance is a testament to our
collaboration.

17
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:44,323
We are the Cauchy Dragons
