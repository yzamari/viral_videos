    "reasoning": "A Family Guy-style comedy necessitates a cartoon aesthetic. Vibrant colors will make the animated title card and the magical elements of the 'Dragon's Crystal Ball' visually engaging for Instagram's general audience. The cartoon style also lends itself well to visual metaphors and comedic exaggeration, making complex math concepts more accessible and entertaining.",

    "reasoning": "The requirement is for a HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds. Placing it at the top_center ensures it's the first and most prominent element the viewer sees, dominating the initial 3 seconds as intended, and leaving the majority of the screen clear for the animated effects. This also adheres to Instagram's guideline of avoiding the bottom 20%.",
