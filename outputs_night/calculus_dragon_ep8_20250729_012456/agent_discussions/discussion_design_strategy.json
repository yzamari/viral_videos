    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Design the title card with vibrant, contrasting colors that pop on mobile screens, incorporating dynamic camera movements and particle effects for 'epicness'., Utilize split-screen techniques to visually contrast 'smooth flying' (continuous function) with 'teleporting' (discontinuous function) or landing from different directions (one-sided limits) to enhance clarity., Develop a distinct visual gag for each calculus concept \u2013 e.g., the dragon sputtering or clipping through an obstacle for discontinuities, or perfectly hugging a target for continuity.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is cramming all the specified calculus topics (epsilon-delta, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity conditions, types of discontinuities, intermediate value theorem) into 40 seconds while maintaining the Family Guy comedic style and ensuring the analogies are clear and not overly convoluted.",
      "Ensuring the visual metaphors are clear and directly map to the calculus concepts without becoming overly convoluted or confusing within the short duration.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the 'Family Guy style comedy' with the accurate, albeit simplified, explanation of calculus concepts; the humor must serve the learning, not overshadow it, which can be tricky with abstract definitions like epsilon-delta.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the 'Family Guy style comedy' and 'epic effects' with the technical accuracy and clarity of the mathematical concepts. Overly chaotic visuals or humor that overshadows the educational component could dilute the message and reduce its value.",
      "Balancing the comedic Family Guy style with the educational content so it doesn't undermine the learning aspect or feel disrespectful to the subject matter.",
      "Ensuring the visual metaphors are instantly understandable and directly map to the calculus principles within the tight 40-second timeframe, especially for concepts like the Cauchy criterion, will require very precise animation and scripting."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "For the title card, animate the text 'Smooth Dragon Flights!!' to burst onto the screen with trails of fire and smoke, perhaps with a subtle 'whoosh' sound effect. Immediately transition to a scene where a Family Guy-esque dragon pilot is trying to teach a less-than-attentive student, framing each calculus concept with a flight analogy.",
      "Develop a distinct visual gag for each calculus concept \u2013 e.g., the dragon sputtering or clipping through an obstacle for discontinuities, or perfectly hugging a target for continuity.",
      "The epsilon-delta definition can be visualized as the dragon needing to stay within a very small, precise 'landing zone' (epsilon) regardless of its approach path (delta).",
      "Design the title card with vibrant, contrasting colors that pop on mobile screens, incorporating dynamic camera movements and particle effects for 'epicness'.",
      "Incorporate distinct visual cues for each calculus topic: for epsilon-delta, show the dragon attempting to land perfectly within a tiny designated landing zone; for one-sided limits, demonstrate landing from only one direction versus another; for discontinuities, use abrupt teleportation or sudden dips in altitude, contrasted with smooth, consistent flight.",
      "Utilize split-screen techniques to visually contrast 'smooth flying' (continuous function) with 'teleporting' (discontinuous function) or landing from different directions (one-sided limits) to enhance clarity.",
      "For the visual metaphors: depict 'smooth flying' with fluid, continuous arcs against a clear sky, directly contrasting with 'teleporting' which could be represented by abrupt, glitchy jumps in position. Landing from different directions can illustrate limits approaching a point from either side (one-sided limits), and abrupt altitude changes versus gradual ascents/descents will visually map to continuity and discontinuities.",
      "Utilize a color scheme for the title card that screams 'epic' and 'dragon' \u2013 perhaps a gradient from a fiery sunset orange to a deep, majestic violet or indigo, with bold, slightly distressed typography for 'Smooth Dragon Flights!!'. The 'epic effects' should incorporate motion trails and subtle lighting flares around the text. For the content, employ a consistent, warm color palette for the main flight animations, shifting to cooler, perhaps slightly jarring colors for moments of discontinuity to visually reinforce the concept.",
      "Utilize clear visual metaphors through typography: 'Teleporting' could be represented by a jarring font shift or stuttering animation, while 'Smooth Flying' uses flowing, consistent lettering. Ensure the visual design for each theorem or concept uses a consistent typographic treatment to reinforce the connection, aiding comprehension within the short timeframe.",
      "For the title card, consider a dynamic animation where the words 'Smooth Dragon Flights' assemble with a fiery or smoky effect, using a bold, blocky font. For the educational segments, employ a clean, sans-serif font for dialogue (e.g., 'Open Sans' or 'Lato') and a slightly bolder or italicized version for key terms like 'epsilon' or 'delta', always ensuring sufficient contrast against the background.",
      "Keep the dialogue punchy and short, leveraging the Family Guy style for comedic timing and relatable character interactions between the pilot and a student."

    "consensus_points": [
      "For 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!', we need to prioritize a bold, eye-catching title card with Family Guy-esque animation and 'epic effects' to hook viewers immediately, followed by a fast-paced, visually driven explanation of calculus concepts using flight analogies to maintain engagement within the 40-second Instagram timeframe. The humor and visual metaphors will be key to making abstract ideas accessible and shareable.",
      "For the 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!' title card, prioritizing a bold, legible font like 'Impact' or a stylized, slightly condensed sans-serif that evokes motion and excitement is crucial. The animation should clearly convey 'Smooth Dragon Flights' with trailing smoke or fiery trails, ensuring the text is readable for the full 3 seconds against dynamic effects.  For the educational content, the visual design must maintain a clear hierarchy of information, using distinct typographic styles for dialogue, theorem names, and visual cues to guide the viewer through the complex concepts.",
      "For 'EPISODE 8: Smooth Dragon Flights!!', the title card needs a vibrant, almost explosive color palette \u2013 think fiery oranges and deep, regal purples \u2013 with dynamic motion that mimics a dragon's powerful yet controlled ascent to instantly capture the Instagram audience's attention. The core of the video must leverage the comedic narrative to make abstract calculus concepts like epsilon-delta and continuity relatable through flight analogies, ensuring the humor enhances, not distracts from, the educational value to maximize engagement and shareability within the short format."
