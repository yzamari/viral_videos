1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,096
Behold Ehud Barak, Israel's most decorated
soldier.

2
00:00:03,096 --> 00:00:05,173
His medals shone, a dazzling display.

3
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:05,519
They

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,112
called him Israel's most brilliant Prime
Minister.

5
00:00:08,112 --> 00:00:09,030
His intellect was renowned.

6
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,720
At Camp David,

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,632
he proposed a peace deal, a bold

8
00:00:13,632 --> 00:00:14,077
initiative.

9
00:00:14,077 --> 00:00:16,752
Yet, Yasser Arafat rejected his every

10
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:17,197
proposal.

11
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:19,872
The Second Intifada erupted, a devastating

12
00:00:19,872 --> 00:00:20,605
conflict.

13
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:25,008
Barak, a man of many facets,

14
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:28,224
once undertook a clandestine operation in
disguise.

15
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:32,064
He demonstrated a remarkable understanding
of gender

16
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:32,269
fluidity.

17
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:33,504
His coalition government fractured, a
swift

18
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:34,666
and tragic collapse.

19
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:35,828
Victory eluded him;

20
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:36,216
he

21
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:37,584
suffered a crushing defeat to Ariel
Sharon.

22
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:40,789
It was a historic loss.

23
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:42,072
Later, on

24
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:43,384
Epstein's island, he famously quipped, "I
kept my underwear on!

25
00:00:43,384 --> 00:00:44,304
" Now, he reflects on his legacy.
