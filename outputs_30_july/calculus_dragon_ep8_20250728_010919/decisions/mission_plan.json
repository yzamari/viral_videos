  "mission_statement": "Create a Family Guy style comedy where dragon pilot teaches function limits and continuity. Cover epsilon-delta definition, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity conditions, types of discontinuities, and the intermediate value theorem. Use visual metaphors: smooth flying vs teleporting, landing from different directions, altitude changes. Make limits and continuity intuitive through flight analogies.",

  "target_outcome": "Achieve a 10% engagement rate (likes, comments, shares) and a 5% increase in followers within 24 hours of posting, demonstrating audience understanding of at least one key concept (e.g., epsilon-delta definition or continuity) through comments.",
