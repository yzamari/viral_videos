Dragon conductor runs the SEQUENCE EXPRESS train where each car represents a term approaching the limit station! Epsilon and delta are friendly train inspectors ensuring passengers stay within bounds. Dragon explains convergence through hilarious train announcements, shows the squeeze theorem as trains merging on parallel tracks, and bounded sequences as safety rails. Include funny passenger reactions, dragon's train conductor jokes, and visual demonstrations of limits. Educational and entertaining!",

[VISUAL: Dragon conductor at the helm, train cars labeled with sequence terms approaching a 'Limit Station'. Epsilon and Delta, friendly inspectors, check passenger bounds.] DIALOGUE: Each car is a term heading to its limit. Our inspectors, Epsilon and Delta, keep everything in bounds. [VISUAL: Dragon making announcements over the PA system, showing a train slowing down towards the station.] DIALOGUE: \"Next stop, convergence! Watch as these terms get closer and closer to our destination!\" [VISUAL: Two trains on parallel tracks merging. Safety rails are visible along the track.] DIALOGUE: \"Observe the Squeeze Theorem! These trains on parallel tracks merge beautifully, just like our sequences approaching the limit.\" [VISUAL: Passengers reacting comically to train movements, Dragon making a joke.] DIALOGUE: \"And for safety, we have bounded sequences, our trusty safety rails! Hold on tight, folks!\"",
    "final_script": "Welcome aboard the Sequence Dragon Express! Each car holds a term approaching its limit. Epsilon and Delta, our expert inspectors, ensure everything remains within bounds. Next stop, convergence! Watch these terms draw closer to their destination. Observe the Squeeze Theorem in action; parallel tracks merge beautifully, mirroring our converging sequences. For safety, we rely on bounded sequences, our dependable safety rails. Hold on tight, everyone! The journey is about to get exciting",
