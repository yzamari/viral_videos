    "reasoning": "The 'Family Guy cutaway' reference strongly suggests a cartoon style. The themes of dragons, infinite staircases, and time loops are playful and lend themselves well to a vibrant, animated cartoon aesthetic that will appeal to a general audience on Instagram. This style allows for expressive character designs and dynamic visual storytelling for complex mathematical concepts.",

    "primary_overlay_position": "bottom_center",
    "positioning_strategy": "static",
    "reasoning": "The content is a narrative explanation of mathematical concepts using a cartoon style, reminiscent of an educational or explanatory video. Positioning the text at the bottom center is a common and effective strategy for overlays in such content, ensuring readability without obstructing the main visual narrative of the dragon. Instagram's guideline to avoid the bottom 20% is respected by placing it slightly higher, and 'bottom_center' is a generally safe area on most mobile platforms for this type of content.",
