00:00.000 --> 00:01.759

I am inevitable,

00:02.938 --> 00:04.665
he declares with mighty power.

00:04.665 --> 00:06.047
With a snap, the

00:06.347 --> 00:10.318
Mandate vanishes in comic smoke and
exploding panels.

00:10.318 --> 00:10.814
He

00:11.114 --> 00:15.189
leads the cabinet with yoga, building
kibbutzim with pure

00:15.489 --> 00:15.988
energy.

00:15.988 --> 00:19.982

Ben-Gurion will

00:20.282 --> 00:20.880
return.

00:20.880 --> 00:25.663
His legacy endures, a testament to his
unwavering

00:25.963 --> 00:27.519
vision and revolutionary spirit.

00:27.519 --> 00:29.464
The sands whisper his name,

00:29.764 --> 00:31.189
a legend etched in time.

00:31.189 --> 00:32.898
His impact resonates, echoing through
generations
