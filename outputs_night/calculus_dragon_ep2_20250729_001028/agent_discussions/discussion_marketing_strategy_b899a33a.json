      "message": "To maximize engagement on Instagram for 'Sequence Dragon Express', the video must leverage the Family Guy-style comedy and dynamic visuals. We need to create short, digestible segments that capture attention immediately, even without sound, focusing on the visual gags and the core concept of limits through the train analogy.",

      "message": "For 'Sequence Dragon Express' on Instagram, the key to engagement lies in leveraging the Family Guy-esque humor and clear visual storytelling. The animated title card needs to be punchy and attention-grabbing within the first three seconds. Each car representing a sequence term should have distinct visual cues, and the 'Dragon conductor's' announcements need to be brief, witty, and easily digestible via subtitles. Demonstrating convergence through merging tracks and bounded sequences via safety rails offers strong visual metaphors that will resonate.",

      "reasoning": "The proposed video concept directly addresses the need for engaging, educational content on Instagram. Its humor and strong visual metaphors align with the platform's consumption habits, while the focus on clear explanations of mathematical concepts ensures educational value. The 'unknown duration' requires a structure that can be trimmed or extended without losing impact.",

        "Ensure the 'epic effects' on the title card are high-quality animation that aligns with a premium brand feel, despite the comedic tone. For example, stylized dragon scales forming the letters, or a train blast effect. <br> [VISUAL: Dragon's fiery breath forming the title 'SEQUENCE DRAGON EXPRESS'] <br> DIALOGUE: All aboard the limit express!",
        "For visual demonstrations: Epsilon and Delta can be depicted as quirky, official-looking characters with clipboards, checking the 'distance' of each car from the 'limit station' with comical exaggerated tools. <br> [VISUAL: Epsilon holding a comically large caliper to a train car] <br> DIALOGUE: Just a little bit closer now!",
        "The 'squeeze theorem' visual should clearly show two trains (representing sequences) converging towards a single track (the limit) as they approach the 'limit station'. <br> [VISUAL: Two distinct trains on parallel tracks merging into one] <br> DIALOGUE: When two tracks meet the same destination...",
        "To ensure maximum reach and engagement, create several shorter, high-impact clips derived from the main video, focusing on specific jokes or concepts (e.g., a funny passenger reaction, a specific conductor joke, or a clear demonstration of a single concept) for use as Reels or Stories. <br> [VISUAL: A passenger looking bewildered as a train car floats away] <br> DIALOGUE: Is this seat supposed to move this much?"
