    "reasoning": "The prompt explicitly mentions 'Marvel Comics epic' and describes visual elements strongly associated with comic book art, such as 'underground panel,' 'thought bubble,' 'slow-mo panels,' and character breakdowns. A comic style will best capture the dynamic storytelling and iconic imagery described, appealing to a general audience on Instagram who are likely familiar with or drawn to this aesthetic. Vibrant colors are typical for Marvel and will make the post visually striking.",

    "reasoning": "The content has a lot of text and visual elements. Placing the overlay towards the bottom center on Instagram provides a good balance, allowing viewers to see the primary action of the video while still being able to read the text without it feeling too cramped or occluding important visuals. Instagram's safe zone for the bottom 20% is respected, and this placement offers good readability.",
