    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: For the 'exploding organizational chart,' a sharp, digitized 'shatter' sound effect coupled with a quick zoom-out will enhance the visual chaos. For the Stewie-style minister's line, a subtle, slightly distorted vocal effect could add to the caricature., The 'COMMITTEE COUNT: \u221e' news ticker needs a distinct, repeating sound cue that builds in intensity or annoyance to match the visual. Maryam's eye twitch should be punctuated by a subtle, sharp 'pop' or 'click' sound effect., Allocate approximately 3-4 seconds for Maryam's initial announcement and the exploding org chart visual. The 'committee count: \u221e' ticker should be visible for at least 5 seconds. The Stewie-style minister cutaway needs about 5-6 seconds to land the joke with the nodding officials. The 'Chairman of Nothing' lower third and Maryam's eye twitch should be concise, around 3 seconds. The multiplying map and 'this is fine' meme should be the final visual punch, around 6-8 seconds.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is maintaining the comedic timing within the desired duration. Overly long visual sequences or unnecessary pauses between spoken lines could dilute the humor and impact, potentially leading to viewer drop-off on YouTube.",
      "The 'Unknown Duration' is a significant concern. We need to quickly confirm this to properly segment timing and ensure compliance with the 38-42 second window. Without a target, precision is impossible.",
      "The biggest concern is fitting all the visual gags and dialogue within the 40-second \u00b15% window without making it feel rushed. If the pacing is too fast, the humor might be lost. Conversely, if it's too slow, the momentum will drop."

      "Integrate the 'This is fine' meme at the very end for a punchy, memorable conclusion that reinforces the satirical point and taps into existing online culture for virality.",

      "Prioritize sharp transitions between segments. For instance, a quick zoom or a graphic wipe could lead into the Stewie cutaway. Ensure the sound design complements the visuals, with exaggerated sound effects for graphics and subtle comedic stings for character reactions.",
