  "mission": "Marvel intro: Moshe Sharett materializes between Ben-Gurion appearances like Ant-Man - 'Did anyone notice I was here?' Montage of being overshadowed, papers flying past him in slow-mo. Spider-Man style inner monologue: 'With great responsibility comes... being ignored by history.' Shows diplomatic skills like Doctor Strange's hand movements creating peace treaties. Villain reveal: Ben-Gurion's shadow literally consuming screen. Post-credit: Still in office, checking watch, 'Is it 1955 yet?' Stan Lee cameo as confused citizen: 'Who's the Prime Minister again?'",
