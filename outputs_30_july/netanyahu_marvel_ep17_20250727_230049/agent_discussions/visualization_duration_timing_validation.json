We need to maintain a high energy throughout, ensuring each distinct action is punchy and visually distinct to maximize engagement within the \u00b15% duration tolerance. The core challenge is translating the chaotic narrative into a visually coherent, yet frenetic, experience that keeps viewers hooked until the final Israeli flag flourish.",

          "message": "To maximize engagement for this 'Marvel Comics explosion!' video on Instagram, we must synchronize the rapid-fire visual cues with equally punchy audio, ensuring each action lands with impact.  The key is to maintain a relentless pace, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats with distinct, comic-book-style visual and sound effects that align with the political satire.  Given the \u00b15% duration tolerance, precise segment timing is crucial to deliver the full narrative arc within the 33.25-36.75 second window.",
