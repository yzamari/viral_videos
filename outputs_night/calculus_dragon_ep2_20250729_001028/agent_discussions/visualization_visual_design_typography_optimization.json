The core concepts like convergence, squeeze theorem, and bounded sequences need clear, visually distinct representations that feel like natural extensions of the train analogy, ensuring educational clarity amidst the comedy.",

Prioritize bold, readable typography for titles and subtitles, ensuring clarity within the fast-paced 40-second runtime. Each visual concept, from the animated title card to the train analogies, needs to be immediately recognizable and reinforce the educational content.",

The visual design must seamlessly transition from this epic intro into fast-paced, visually distinct segments demonstrating convergence, the Squeeze Theorem with merging trains, and bounded sequences as safety rails, all within the 40-second limit.",
