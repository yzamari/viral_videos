00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
Stewie's stuck on infinite stairs,
realizing he is climbing a

00:05.420 --> 00:06.350
monotonic sequence.

00:06.350 --> 00:10.070
He gets stuck in time loops, his recursive

00:10.370 --> 00:11.961
sequences repeating endlessly.

00:11.961 --> 00:15.673
He learns about number 'e' and nested

00:15.973 --> 00:18.833
intervals, like shrinking Russian dolls.

00:18.833 --> 00:21.693
Subsequences appear, tiny versions of

00:21.993 --> 00:24.423
the journey, hinting at
Bolzano-Weierstrass.

00:24.423 --> 00:26.852
A bounded monotonic sequence must

00:27.152 --> 00:28.742
converge, even if the stairs never end!
