We need sharp transitions between Maryam's commentary, the Peter Griffin-style warriors' chaos, Brian's intellectual faux pas, and the absurd chicken fight. The animation style needs to maintain the Family Guy aesthetic while emphasizing the 'disheveled' and 'running' aspects of Maryam's appearance to convey the escalating chaos and desperation.",

          "message": "To make this 'Family Guy apocalypse finale' engaging on YouTube, focus on hyper-realistic sound design for the 'WITNESS ME!' moment and the water truck impact to maximize comedic payoff. The pacing must be rapid, ensuring each cutaway lands with punch and contributes to the overall satirical absurdity within the 60-second timeframe.",
