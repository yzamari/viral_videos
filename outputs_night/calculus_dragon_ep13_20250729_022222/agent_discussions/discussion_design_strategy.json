    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Create a bold, retro-inspired animated title card for 'Dragon Detective Agency' using dynamic fonts and fiery dragon animation to immediately capture attention. The 'epic effects' could involve glowing scales or a powerful roar morphing into the title., For visual metaphors, depict the dragon detective meticulously 'dusting for prints' on the function's graph to find critical points, or 'interrogating' the second derivative graph to determine inflection points and concavity, aligning with the investigation theme., For the 3-second title card, use a bold, blocky font reminiscent of Family Guy's style for 'EPISODE 13: Dragon Detective Agency!!', with fiery dragon-like particle effects and a dramatic zoom, perhaps ending with the dragon character appearing.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is balancing the comedic Family Guy style with the accuracy and clarity of the mathematical concepts. Over-simplification could dilute the educational value, while overly complex explanations will lose the audience in 40 seconds.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the comedic Family Guy style with the educational content; the humor must not overshadow the clarity of the mathematical concepts being taught.",
      "Ensuring the educational components are clear and digestible within the short duration and comedic style without sacrificing accuracy is a primary concern. The visual metaphors need to be intuitive and directly linked to the mathematical concepts being taught.",
      "The primary concern is cramming the entire systematic function analysis into 40 seconds while maintaining the comedic tone and clear educational value; each step must be extremely visually concise and quickly explained."

      "For visual metaphors, depict the dragon detective meticulously 'dusting for prints' on the function's graph to find critical points, or 'interrogating' the second derivative graph to determine inflection points and concavity, aligning with the investigation theme.",
      "Incorporate a clear, readable sans-serif font for all in-video text, ensuring it remains legible even on mobile screens. Use this for mathematical expressions and key findings, perhaps styled as 'case files' or 'clues'.",
      "During the function analysis segments, use exaggerated facial expressions and physical comedy from the dragon character to illustrate concepts like critical points and inflection points, making the 'mood swings' for concavity particularly visual and funny.",
      "For the title card, use a bold, slightly distorted font for 'Dragon Detective Agency' with a fiery dragon silhouette breathing out the episode number '13' in a dynamic, particle-filled animation, perhaps in a deep, authoritative blue transitioning to an energetic red.",
      "For the 3-second title card, use a bold, blocky font reminiscent of Family Guy's style for 'EPISODE 13: Dragon Detective Agency!!', with fiery dragon-like particle effects and a dramatic zoom, perhaps ending with the dragon character appearing.",
      "Create a bold, retro-inspired animated title card for 'Dragon Detective Agency' using dynamic fonts and fiery dragon animation to immediately capture attention. The 'epic effects' could involve glowing scales or a powerful roar morphing into the title.",
      "Throughout the video, use a 'case file' visual motif for each step of function analysis, with colors shifting to reflect the dragon's 'mood' \u2013 perhaps a calm, analytical blue for domain, a sharp, alert yellow for critical points, and a volatile red-orange for inflection points, all within the Family Guy aesthetic.",
      "Design the title card animation to transition seamlessly from the epic opening to the introduction of the 'Dragon Detective' character, perhaps with a magnifying glass revealing the episode title."

    "consensus_points": [
      "For this 'Dragon Detective Agency' episode, the visual design must perfectly blend Family Guy's comedic aesthetic with the systematic nature of function analysis. The 3-second animated title card needs to be impactful with 'epic effects' that hint at both dragons and investigation, setting a strong visual tone. Subsequent visuals should use clear, engaging metaphors like a detective examining clues for domain, or a dragon's 'mood swings' representing concavity, all within the 40-second Instagram timeframe.",
      "To maximize engagement for 'Dragon Detective Agency' on Instagram, the 40-second format demands rapid pacing and clear visual storytelling. The Family Guy style animation, combined with strong typographic elements for the title card, will immediately capture attention.  The systematic function analysis must be broken down into digestible, visually driven segments, using the detective metaphor to maintain viewer interest and aid comprehension.",
      "To make 'Dragon Detective Agency' engaging on Instagram, the title card needs to evoke both mystery and humor, using colors like deep purples and fiery oranges. The 40-second format requires rapid-fire visual metaphors, like the dragon's mood dictating the curve's concavity, making complex math digestible and entertaining for a broad audience."
