  "mission": "EPISODE 7: Function Dragon Transform!! Show this as HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects! Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon shape-shifter teaches functions. Explain transformation rules, domain and range, one-to-one and onto functions, bijections, function composition, even/odd functions, and periodic functions. Use visual metaphors: dragon transformation machine, territory maps, mirror and rotational symmetry. Make abstract function concepts concrete and entertaining.",

[VISUAL: Baby dragon in a 'transformation machine' with input/output slots] DIALOGUE: I am the Function Dragon! Watch as I change forms, following strict transformation rules. [VISUAL: 'Territory maps' showing domain and range, then a dragon that is only one-to-one] DIALOGUE: My domain is where I can go; my range is where I can appear. Sometimes, each input has only one output. [VISUAL: Dragon showing mirror symmetry (even) and rotational symmetry (odd), then two dragons combining] DIALOGUE: My reflections define me. And sometimes, my powers combine, creating new forms! [VISUAL: Dragon cycling through forms on a loop] DIALOGUE: From simple shifts to complex cycles, functions are the magic of change!",
