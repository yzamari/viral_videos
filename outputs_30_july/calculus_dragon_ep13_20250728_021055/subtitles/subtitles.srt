1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,194
This case is a complete mess!

2
00:00:02,494 --> 00:00:05,942
My dragon senses pinpoint a function

3
00:00:06,242 --> 00:00:07,000
needing analysis.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,515
We first establish its

5
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:09,050
domain:

6
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,990
where it can roam.

7
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,225
Next,

8
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:14,417
identify critical points â€“ potential ups

9
00:00:14,717 --> 00:00:16,346
and downs.

10
00:00:16,346 --> 00:00:19,602
The first derivative reveals

11
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:24,004
its mood swings, showing increases and

12
00:00:24,304 --> 00:00:24,817
decreases.

13
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:27,386
The second derivative indicates concavity,

14
00:00:27,686 --> 00:00:29,898
the curve's emotional state.

15
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:31,004
We seek

16
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:33,028
asymptotes, the function's boundaries.

17
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:33,890
Inflection points

18
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,130
mark significant attitude shifts.

19
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:35,600
Finally, we

20
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,590
sketch the complete picture.

21
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:36,935
Case closed:

22
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:37,624
another function's mystery solved
