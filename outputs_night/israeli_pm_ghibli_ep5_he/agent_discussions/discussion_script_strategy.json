    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Emphasize the visual transformation of swords into olive trees and the military uniform into peace garments with quick, impactful cuts. Each visual transition should align with a powerful, short voiceover or text overlay., Dedicate a segment to Rabin's 'blue eyes full of pain and compassion,' using close-ups and emotive music to convey the weight of sacrifice and the profound nature of peace-building. This emotional anchor is crucial for virality., The handshake with Arafat evolving into a rainbow bridge over Jerusalem should be the climactic visual, timed perfectly with soaring, heartfelt music. This will serve as the ultimate hopeful takeaway.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is balancing the complexity of the historical event and the symbolic magic within a strict 64-second timeframe, ensuring the message of peace and sacrifice is clear without feeling rushed or overly simplified.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the visual transitions appear seamless and magical, not jarring, within the short timeframe. The historical sensitivity must be handled with utmost respect, letting the 'magic' serve the narrative of peace and sacrifice, not overshadow it.",
      "Ensuring the historical context and the emotional weight of Rabin's sacrifice are conveyed respectfully and effectively within the 'magical' Ghibli aesthetic, without trivializing the subject matter, is a primary concern.",
      "Ensuring the Ghibli-esque magic feels authentic and not overly fantastical, while still conveying the profound shift from conflict to peace, is a delicate balance. The transition must be visually seamless and emotionally impactful within the short duration.",
      "Balancing the visual spectacle with the emotional depth of Rabin's journey is critical. Over-reliance on spectacle might detract from the profound message; under-delivery on the Ghibli magic might make it less engaging for the platform.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the sensitive historical context and the depiction of specific political figures are handled with utmost respect and nuance, even within a stylized Ghibli framework. Visuals must be evocative rather than literal, and the audio should reflect solemnity and hope without being overly simplistic."

      "Dedicate a segment to Rabin's 'blue eyes full of pain and compassion,' using close-ups and emotive music to convey the weight of sacrifice and the profound nature of peace-building. This emotional anchor is crucial for virality.",
      "Script Segment 1: [VISUAL: Desolate battlefield, rain. Close on Yitzhak Rabin in uniform, weary.] DIALOGUE: A soldier's fight.",
      "Use short, evocative text overlays that complement the visuals without overwhelming them, focusing on themes of sacrifice, peace, and transformation.",
      "Use minimal, impactful dialogue or text overlays that are easily readable within seconds, focusing on keywords like 'soldier,' 'peacemaker,' 'sacrifice,' and 'peace.' This adheres to TikTok's subtitle-friendly format.",
      "Emphasize Rabin's eyes as a recurring motif. A close-up on his blue eyes, conveying 'pain and compassion,' should be strategically placed before and after pivotal moments to highlight the weight of his decisions.",

      "Script Segment 3: [VISUAL: Uniform shifts to serene white garments.] DIALOGUE: Embrace the hopeful dawn.",
      "**Viral Hooks:** Utilize the 'swords to olive trees' transformation as the initial visual hook, followed by the striking shift from military to white garments. The 'blue eyes full of pain and compassion' close-up can be a powerful emotional hook for shares, and the rainbow bridge over Jerusalem serves as the ultimate climactic visual that encapsulates the video's inspiring message. Hashtags like #PeaceHero #StudioGhibli #YitzhakRabin #Inspiration #Hope should be leveraged.",

Each segment should be 7-10 seconds, supported by brief, evocative text overlays or minimal voiceover (e.g., 'From battle, to bloom.', 'A hero's sacrifice.', 'Peace, forged in light.'). The music should swell dramatically with the rainbow bridge.",
      "Script Segment 7: [VISUAL: Intense close-up of Rabin's blue eyes, filled with pain and deep compassion.] DIALOGUE: Sacrifice is the price.",
