The core of engagement will rely on rapidly switching visual metaphors for each math concept, ensuring even complex ideas like the Cantor set are instantly recognizable and entertaining.  To maximize click-through, the thumbnail must feature the baby dragon in a highly dynamic, perhaps surprised or action-packed pose, with bold, unmissable text hinting at both comedy and math.",

Break down each math concept into short, impactful segments, each with a unique visual gag or metaphor, to prevent viewer drop-off. The dynamic animated title card should be optimized for sound-off viewing with clear text overlays, as Instagram's initial engagement often happens silently.",
