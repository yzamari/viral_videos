      "suggestions": [
        "Open with dramatic, comic-book-style visuals of Ben-Gurion, accompanied by a deep, resonant voiceover: '[VISUAL: Ben-Gurion in dramatic silhouette, thunderous rumble] DIALOGUE: In a world fractured by conflict...' Then pivot to dark humor: '[VISUAL: Quick cut to Ben-Gurion looking annoyed, a tiny 'POW!' graphic] DIALOGUE: His superpower? Refusing to quit.'",
        "Use fast-paced, stylized editing with comic-book sound effects (like 'THWACK!' or 'ZAP!') synchronized with key historical actions, such as declaring independence. The voiceover should deliver punchy, 1-2 sentence lines that frame his achievements as almost absurdly difficult tasks he simply *had* to complete, like: '[VISUAL: Text 'FOUNDER' flashes onscreen] DIALOGUE: He didn't have a secret lair. Just a very persistent will.'",
        "Incorporate dynamic text overlays that mimic comic book captions (e.g., 'THE UNYIELDING WILL!', 'MISSION: NATION BUILDING'). Keep sentences concise and impactful, ensuring each segment is digestible within 2-3 seconds for optimal Instagram Reel viewing.",
        "End with a slightly self-aware, meta-commentary: '[VISUAL: Ben-Gurion walks off into a stylized desert sunset] DIALOGUE: Some heroes wear capes. Others just get the job done. Annoyingly.' This reinforces the satirical tone and leaves a lasting, humorous impression."

      "concerns": [
        "Ensuring the dark humor doesn't trivialize the historical context of Israel's founding is paramount. The satire must be aimed at the *style* of superheroism, not the gravity of the events themselves.",
        "Balancing the rapid pacing required for Instagram with enough visual and narrative substance to introduce Ben-Gurion effectively within 35 seconds will be a challenge.",
        "The success hinges on the voiceover performance carrying the subtle sarcasm and the visual editing maintaining a consistent, high-energy Marvel-esque feel without becoming chaotic."
