Each sound effect \u2013 from the 'CRASH!' through the Knesset walls to the 'ZAP!' of energy beams \u2013 needs to be sharp, layered, and timed to milliseconds with the on-screen action to deliver maximum comic-book impact within the 55-second timeframe.",

The voiceover for 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' needs to be commanding, perfectly timed to the visuals to convey authority amidst the chaos, and maintain the fast-paced narrative within the strict duration.",
