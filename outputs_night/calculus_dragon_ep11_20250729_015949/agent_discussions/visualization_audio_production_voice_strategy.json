The 3-second title card needs to be exceptionally impactful, setting a high-energy, humorous tone immediately, while the ninja training metaphors should visually simplify complex calculus for maximum clarity and memorability.",

The 'sensei' voice for theorems and exaggerated sound effects for indeterminate forms are crucial for clarity and humor, ensuring the 40-second target is met with engaging pacing.",
