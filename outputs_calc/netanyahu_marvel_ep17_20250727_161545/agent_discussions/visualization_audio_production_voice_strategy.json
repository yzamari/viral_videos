The voiceover should have a slightly amplified, commanding tone, perfectly synchronized with each punchy sound effect \u2013 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', 'WHAM!' \u2013 to maximize impact within the 55-second timeframe.",

We need a strong, slightly exaggerated voiceover for the key phrases like 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!', ensuring they land with maximum impact. The sound design should be a symphony of comic book onomatopoeia, seamlessly integrated with the voiceover to create an immersive, high-octane experience that will grab attention.",
