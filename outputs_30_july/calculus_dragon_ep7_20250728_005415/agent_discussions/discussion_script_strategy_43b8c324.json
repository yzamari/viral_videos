For instance, show the dragon on a 'territory map' of allowed dragon forms; if an input tries to go outside the map, it fails spectacularly. For 'one-to-one,' show the dragon transforming into distinct forms for distinct inputs, and then failing when two inputs try to map to the same output, making a mess.",
