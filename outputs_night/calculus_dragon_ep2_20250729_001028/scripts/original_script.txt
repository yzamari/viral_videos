[VISUAL: HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD: 'EPISODE 2: Sequence Dragon Express!!' with epic effects] DIALOGUE: Welcome aboard the Sequence Dragon Express! [VISUAL: Dragon conductor at the helm, train cars labeled with sequence terms approaching a 'Limit Station'. Epsilon and Delta, friendly inspectors, check passenger bounds.] DIALOGUE: Each car is a term heading to its limit. Our inspectors, Epsilon and Delta, keep everything in bounds. [VISUAL: Dragon making announcements over the PA system, showing a train slowing down towards the station.] DIALOGUE: "Next stop, convergence! Watch as these terms get closer and closer to our destination!" [VISUAL: Two trains on parallel tracks merging. Safety rails are visible along the track.] DIALOGUE: "Observe the Squeeze Theorem! These trains on parallel tracks merge beautifully, just like our sequences approaching the limit." [VISUAL: Passengers reacting comically to train movements, Dragon making a joke.] DIALOGUE: "And for safety, we have bounded sequences, our trusty safety rails! Hold on tight, folks!"
