        "Create distinct, comical sound effects for the dragon's climbing and the 'time loop' moments to punctuate the narrative and enhance the comedic timing.",
        "Use a dynamic voice-over that shifts in tone and pace to match the visual gags and the introduction of each mathematical concept, ensuring clarity without sacrificing entertainment value.",

        "Ensure that the audio for each math concept is clean and easily understandable, even with the comedic elements, so viewers can grasp the core ideas.",

        "Visually represent the 'infinite staircase' as a visually escalating challenge for the dragon, perhaps with changing textures or background elements for each math concept introduced.",

        "For 'recursive sequences' and the time loop, implement visual repetition or visual glitches in the animation, mirroring the concept of a repeating pattern.",
        "The appearance of 'e' could be signaled by a subtle visual cue like 'natural growth' in the dragon's size or a leafy vine appearing on the stairs, followed by a quick animated graphic of 'e'.",
        "Represent 'Cantor's lemma' with visually nested boxes or shrinking staircase segments, and 'subsequences' as 'dragon cousins' by showing similar-looking baby dragons briefly joining the main one.",
        "The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem can be illustrated by showing the dragon occasionally getting 'stuck' in a pattern but eventually finding a 'convergent cousin' that leads it to a stable point on the stairs.",
        "Ensure each segment is visually distinct and paired with a concise, punchy subtitle that reinforces the math concept.",
