    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Visually represent each distinct action (Knesset crash, vanishing parties, exploding panels, texting, energy beams, split nation) with dynamic, exaggerated comic book panel transitions and sound effects (CRASH, WHOOSH, BOOM, ZAP, THWACK, CRACK) to create a relentless, engaging pace. Ensure the 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' lines are delivered with a powerful, dramatic voice synced perfectly with their visual cues., Incorporate bold, on-screen text overlays for each sound effect and key phrase to reinforce the comic book feel and aid comprehension, especially for viewers watching with sound off. The final shot of the Israeli flag with lightning bolts should be a powerful, concluding visual punch., Craft a highly condensed script, allocating 2-3 seconds max per distinct action (e.g., 'Opposition parties vanish in comic smoke. WHOOSH!'). This requires extremely precise timing for each visual and sound cue.",
