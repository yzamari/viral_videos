The throne awaits; Peres finally sits.  But the 'Acting PM' title mocks his every move. He reaches for the gavel, a weighty symbol of power, strain etched deep on his face. Operation Grapes erupts, a nightmare of missiles raining down uncontrollably.  What have I done? The Qana disaster unfolds, a catastrophic accident.  Horror grips the nation.  The election battle rages; Bibi and Peres clash. A razor-thin margin of one percent!  An agonizingly close defeat. Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.  Mr. Peace becomes President ofâ€¦ nothing at all.  At ninety-three, his dreams dim, a legacy unfulfilled.
