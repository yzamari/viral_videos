Then, dedicate around 10-12 seconds to the animated map sequence with the water droplets. The Peter Griffin-style official's line needs about 5-7 seconds, followed by the citizens licking dew for 5-7 seconds. The final lower third and outro should be roughly 8-10 seconds, ensuring the total stays within the 40 \u00b15% range., Visual pacing: The 'running away with suitcases' visual for the water droplets should be animated with exaggerated speed and comedic timing to enhance the absurdity. The Peter Griffin character's delivery of 'Water? Never heard of her.' should be accompanied by a visual cue like a shrug or a blank stare, reinforcing the humor without needing extra dialogue., Audio emphasis: Ensure Maryam's 'ghosted Iran' line is delivered with a slightly dramatic but still comedic tone.

        "Technical Approach: Utilize sharp cuts to maintain the rapid-fire pacing characteristic of Family Guy. Ensure the Iran International logo is consistently visible but unobtrusive in the top-right corner. The news ticker should be a standard lower-third graphic, moving at a normal pace. The citizen licking dew scene needs a slight comedic zoom or focus to emphasize the absurdity. The final lower third should be clean and professional-looking, contrasting with the content.",
