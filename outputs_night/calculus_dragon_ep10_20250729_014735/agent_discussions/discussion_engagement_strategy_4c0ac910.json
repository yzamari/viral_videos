        "Integrate sound design and quick cuts to maintain energy. Use Family Guy-style sound effects and comedic timing to punctuate the calculus explanations within the Olympic framework.",
        "Incorporate on-screen text that briefly defines the calculus concept being visualized, keeping it concise and impactful for Instagram's fast consumption.",
