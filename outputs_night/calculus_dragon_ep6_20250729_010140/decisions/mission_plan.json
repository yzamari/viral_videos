  "mission_statement": "EPISODE 6: Power-Up Dragon Mathematics!! Show this as HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD at the beginning for 3 seconds with epic effects! Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon in power-up workshop teaches rational and real exponents, then explores topology. Cover fractional powers, real exponents as limits, accumulation points, isolated points, open and closed sets, interior and closure, and the Cantor set. Use visual metaphors: power transformations, dragon gatherings, bubble zones, fractal magic. Make topology concepts accessible and fun.",

  "target_outcome": "Achieve a 15% engagement rate (likes, comments, shares) and a 5% increase in followers within 24 hours of posting, demonstrating comprehension of at least one key concept (fractional exponents or topology basics) through audience comments.",
  "strategic_approach": "Employ a fast-paced, visually engaging Family Guy-esque comedic style to introduce complex mathematical concepts using relatable metaphors.  Prioritize clear visual explanations over lengthy exposition.",
