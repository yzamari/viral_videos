Behold, young one, the blurry future of
this function!

00:00:03,314 --> 00:00:03,683
We

3
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:08,188
approximate it with a simple line, like a
predictable prediction.

4
00:00:08,488 --> 00:00:13,373
Then, a touch more magic, a quadratic
curve, bringing clarity

5
00:00:13,673 --> 00:00:14,110
closer.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,036
Each term, a shrinking error, a purer
glimpse of

7
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:19,475
truth revealed.

8
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:24,031
Infinite terms, a perfect prediction, the
true infinite

9
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:25,367
magic of series unfolds.
