1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,024
First, they ignore you.

2
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,536
Then, they

3
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,032
mock you.

4
00:00:02,032 --> 00:00:03,024
Then, they attack you.

5
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:03,887
Then, you win.

6
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:04,751
President Carter declared

7
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:05,852
a new era of understanding.

8
00:00:05,852 --> 00:00:06,072
President

9
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,784
Sadat proclaimed peace as the only

10
00:00:08,784 --> 00:00:09,296
path.

11
00:00:09,296 --> 00:00:11,856
A fragile hope emerged, a

12
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:15,096
scent of doves in the air.

13
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:18,648
But chaos erupted in Beirut, a

14
00:00:18,648 --> 00:00:20,504
brutal display of power.

15
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:21,432
Destruction unfolded,

16
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:23,004
a horrifying spectacle.

17
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:24,576
The prize, once

18
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,615
so close, now slipped away.

19
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:28,224
From

20
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:30,527
terrorist to peacemaker, a winding,
arduous

21
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:30,879
path.

22
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,640
The weight of it all

23
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:32,939
is almost unbearable.

24
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:33,537
The journey is long and treacherous.

25
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:33,936
The future remains uncertain.
