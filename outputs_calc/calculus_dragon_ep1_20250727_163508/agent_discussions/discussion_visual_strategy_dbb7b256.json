This pacing aligns with quick cuts and allows for clear subtitle display on Instagram., Allocate specific visual cues and sound effects for each segment to enhance the 'magical' and 'family guy cutaway' feel. For instance, a 'POOF!' sound for natural numbers, 'WHOOSH!' for rational numbers, and a distinct, perhaps slightly dissonant, sound for irrational numbers. Visually, use bright, playful animation for cookies, ice cubes, pizza slices, and a dynamic spiral for the irrational number., To address the 'duration & timing validation' and ensure compliance with the 63-second target (\u00b15%), a conservative estimate of 2.8 words per second will be used.
