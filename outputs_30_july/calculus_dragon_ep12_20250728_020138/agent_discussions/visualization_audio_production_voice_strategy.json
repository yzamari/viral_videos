We should leverage the dragon's crystal ball for visual metaphors of increasing precision and shrinking error, while using signature Family Guy-esque sound effects to punctuate comedic beats and mathematical reveals.  The proof of 'e's irrationality needs a frantic, absurd visual presentation to fit the timeframe and comedic tone.",

This will be key to making the complex math accessible and magically entertaining within the tight 35-second timeframe.",

The core synchronization challenge is ensuring each complex concept (linear, quadratic, Taylor's theorem, series, and 'e's irrationality proof) is conveyed with comedic clarity within its allocated 7-8 second slot, maintaining the 35-second \u00b15% target.",
