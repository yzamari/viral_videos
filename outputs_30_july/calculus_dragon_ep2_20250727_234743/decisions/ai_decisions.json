    "primary_style": "cartoon",
    "color_palette": "vibrant",
    "reasoning": "A 'Family Guy style' immediately points to a bold, exaggerated cartoon aesthetic. Vibrant colors are essential for capturing attention on Instagram and making abstract math concepts visually engaging for a general audience. This style allows for the visual metaphors requested (dragon conductor, train cars, epsilon tunnels) to be easily and humorously depicted, fitting the comedic tone and educational goals.",

  "positioning_decision": {
    "primary_overlay_position": "bottom_center",
    "positioning_strategy": "static",
    "reasoning": "For Instagram's portrait aspect ratio, 'bottom_center' is ideal. It keeps the overlay out of the crucial upper 80% of the screen, preventing obstruction of the cartoon visuals. It's also generally a safe zone for information without interfering with key visual elements in the center or top.",

Explain convergence, epsilon-delta definition, unique limit theorem, bounded sequences, arithmetic of limits, and the squeeze theorem. Use visual metaphors: train approaching limit station, epsilon tunnels, safety rails for bounds. Make it entertaining while teaching how sequences converge to limits with mathematical precision.",
