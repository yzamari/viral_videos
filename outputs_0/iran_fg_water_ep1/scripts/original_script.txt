Welcome back to Iran International News. I am your anchor, Maryam. We have breaking news: Scientists have confirmed water has officially ghosted Iran. It left no forwarding address, truly vanishing without a trace. (Visual: Cartoon map of Iran, water droplets with suitcases running away.) We go now to a government official. Sir, what do you say about the water crisis? Water? Never heard of her. Is she single? (Visual: Government official drinking tea nonchalantly.) Meanwhile, citizens are seen licking morning dew off cars. (Persian Subtitle: آب رفت پی کارش) Truly a resourceful nation facing… unexpected departures.
