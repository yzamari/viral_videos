00:00.000 --> 00:04.368
Behold, a baby dragon perched atop an
endless

00:04.368 --> 00:04.776
staircase!

00:04.776 --> 00:07.632
Monotonic means always ascending or always
descending.

00:07.632 --> 00:08.742
This dragon is never falling.

00:08.742 --> 00:09.408
Bounded and monotonic

00:09.408 --> 00:10.050
implies convergence.

00:10.050 --> 00:11.976
The dragon is trapped, caught in

00:11.976 --> 00:12.912
a time loop!

00:12.912 --> 00:14.472
Each step in this recursive

00:14.472 --> 00:17.064
sequence depends on the previous one.

00:17.064 --> 00:17.928
We can

00:17.928 --> 00:19.800
determine the limits of these sequences.

00:19.800 --> 00:20.424
It mirrors

00:20.424 --> 00:21.081
the dragon's journey.

00:21.081 --> 00:22.176
The number *e* symbol of

00:22.176 --> 00:26.124
natural dragon growth, a key mathematical
constant.

00:26.124 --> 00:26.688
Observe

00:26.688 --> 00:30.672
Cantor's dragon boxes, each smaller than
the last.

00:30.672 --> 00:34.584
Subsequences are like the dragon's kin,
related yet

00:34.584 --> 00:35.226
distinct.

00:35.226 --> 00:39.720
The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem assures
bounded sequence possesses

00:39.720 --> 00:40.432
a convergent subsequence.

00:40.432 --> 00:41.856
The dragon always finds its way
