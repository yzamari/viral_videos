    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Allocate precise durations for each of the 8 narrative beats, averaging 8 seconds per panel (e.g., Rabin intro: 7s, Transformation: 8s, Entebbe: 8s, Economy: 7s, Scandal: 8s, Resignation: 7s, Post-credit: 8s, Timeline Split: 7s), totaling 65 seconds. This precise timing is crucial for adherence., Utilize VEO-2's capability for rapid morphing effects between the soldier and PM panels, and sharp visual 'SNAP' effects for the economic crisis to maintain comic book dynamism and brevity., Execute the 'Soldier panels morph to PM' transformation using a quick, layered dissolve effect with an underlying subtle 'whoosh' sound to signify rapid change, allocating approximately 8 seconds. This visual cue immediately establishes the character's evolution, a key narrative beat.",

      "The primary concern is maintaining visual clarity and narrative coherence across eight distinct story beats within such a compressed timeframe. Each panel must be instantly understandable and emotionally resonant, requiring highly efficient visual storytelling and precise editing to avoid overwhelming the viewer.",

This precise timing is crucial for adherence.",
      "For the 'Young Rabin with Star of David shield' and transformation sequence, utilize a split-screen or rapid morphing effect between soldier and PM panels, accompanied by a subtle electronic hum building to a distinct 'transformation' SFX. This visually communicates the duality and change within the allotted ~8 seconds.",

      "During the Entebbe Rescue, animate distinct 'sky-drop' action lines with a powerful 'WHOOSH!' sound effect. Overlay 'COMMANDOS ASSEMBLE!' in bold, impact font. This entire segment should be around 10 seconds, prioritizing the kinetic energy.",
      "For the 'Economic crisis panel: SNAP!', utilize a sharp, impactful sound effect combined with a sudden visual rupture of the panel itself, showing fragments of the economy 'dusting away' to convey immediate financial devastation. This must be executed within 5-7 seconds to ensure it lands with the intended shock."
