[VISUAL: Baby dragon army doing synchronized formations.] DIALOGUE: These little dragons make close formations, just like Cauchy sequences approach their limit. [VISUAL: Dragons flying close, then closer within a tiny box.] DIALOGUE: They always cluster within any tiny epsilon box we give them. [VISUAL: A large dragon (representing a real number) with smaller dragons orbiting it.] DIALOGUE: For real numbers, being Cauchy means they are guaranteed to converge to something. [VISUAL: Dragons covering a space with blankets, no gaps left.] DIALOGUE: Compactness, like Heine-Borel, means we can cover everything with finite blankets, no holes! [VISUAL: Two groups of dragons on a number line, representing Dedekind cuts.] DIALOGUE: Dedekind cuts define real numbers, showing how Cauchy completion makes our number line whole.
