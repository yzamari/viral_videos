Aligning these sound cues with specific visual actions is paramount for maintaining the comic book aesthetic and audience attention, ensuring the overall piece fits the platform's consumption habits and our strict timing requirements.",

        "Emphasize the 'SNAP!' sound effect directly coinciding with the vanishing tunnels for maximum impact, allocating approximately 1.5-2 seconds for this sequence.",
        "Synchronize the 'KA-POW!' with the exploding security barrier panels, aiming for a crisp 1-second audio cue tied to the visual burst.",
        "Allocate approximately 2-3 seconds for the 'GUARDIAN of Israel!' declaration, ensuring it's delivered with vocal energy and accompanied by subtle build-up sound effects before the 'SNAP!'.",

        "The UN speech with energy effects and the 'high-tech nation' montage should be kept very brief, perhaps 5-6 seconds total, leading into the political comeback line 'Bibi will return!' which needs about 3 seconds, concluding with the Israeli flag waving for the final 3-4 seconds."
