To avoid overwhelming the viewer and ensure readability, a central position at the bottom allows for a clear, continuous flow of information as the narrative progresses, without obstructing key visual elements in the comic panels themselves. This position also adheres to Instagram's guideline of avoiding the bottom 20% for overlays, ensuring better visibility.",
