    "reasoning": "Family Guy style comedy directly points to a cartoon aesthetic. Vibrant colors will enhance the epic and engaging nature of the animated title card and make the flight analogies more visually appealing for a general audience on Instagram. Cartoon allows for the visual metaphors and character-driven humor required.",

    "reasoning": "The request specifies a 'HUGE ANIMATED TITLE CARD' at the beginning for 3 seconds. For maximum impact and visibility of a large, animated title card that needs to grab attention immediately, the top center is the most effective position. This avoids any potential obstruction from other UI elements on Instagram and ensures the title is the primary focus. It also adheres to the 'avoid bottom 20%' rule for Instagram.",

Create a Family Guy style comedy where dragon pilot teaches function limits and continuity. Cover epsilon-delta definition, one-sided limits, Cauchy criterion, continuity conditions, types of discontinuities, and the intermediate value theorem. Use visual metaphors: smooth flying vs teleporting, landing from different directions, altitude changes. Make limits and continuity intuitive through flight analogies.",
