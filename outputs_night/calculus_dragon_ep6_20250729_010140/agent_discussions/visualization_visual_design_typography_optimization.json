The typography should be bold and slightly jagged, reminiscent of a dragon's scales or energy bursts.  The Family Guy style will be reinforced through character design and comedic timing, with the baby dragon's expressions and dialogue driving the humor while the visual metaphors for math concepts are clear and whimsical.",
