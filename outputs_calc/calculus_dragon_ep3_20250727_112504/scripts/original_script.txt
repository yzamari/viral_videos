Baby dragon with rocket pack! Let us explore crazy limits! Nth root of a constant! Behold the dragon shrinking spell! Nth root of N approaches one! Magic stabilization! ZOOM to infinity! Some sequences go FOREVER! Divergence in the extended sense is quite spectacular indeed. The ratio test: Compare your neighbors now! See the dragon plants grow! If the ratio is less than one, we converge! Epsilon chicks multiply rapidly, showing divergence. Limits help us understand the infinite!
