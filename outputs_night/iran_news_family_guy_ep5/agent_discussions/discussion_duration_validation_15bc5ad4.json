        "Ensure the news ticker and lower third graphics are synced perfectly with their audio counterparts, if any, and visually prominent. The sound design should emphasize the 'chunky' air and Maryam's cough with a sharp, noticeable effect, followed by the distinct sound of a second mask being deployed."

This breakdown allows for quick transitions and ensures each joke has just enough breathing room.",
