      "suggestions": [
        "Utilize a single, deeply resonant narrator for the entire piece to maintain emotional consistency, ensuring their voice conveys the 'pain and compassion' mentioned. We'll strategically place short, impactful dialogue snippets (1-2 sentences each) to punctuate key visual moments like the sword-to-olive tree transformation and the signing of the Accords.",
        "The audio design should feature a carefully layered score that starts with a somber, military tone, gradually shifting to hopeful and majestic as peace emerges. Subtle Foley sounds for the magical transformations (e.g., a soft rustling for olive trees, a gentle chime for peace angels) should enhance the Ghibli feel and be meticulously synced to visual cues. We'll aim for roughly 8-10 distinct audio segments, each averaging 6-8 seconds, to cover the full 64-second runtime and allow for breathing room and transitions."
