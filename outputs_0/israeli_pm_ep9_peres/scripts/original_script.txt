The throne awaits, finally Peres sits. But 'Acting PM' mocks his every move. He reaches for the hammer, almost worthy. Strain lines erupt from his effort. Operation Grapes explodes into a nightmare. Missiles rain down, uncontrollable. What have I done? The Qana disaster unfolds, a scarlet witch-level accident. Horror. The election battle rages. Bibi and Peres face off in an epic clash. A one percent margin! So unbelievably close. A crushing defeat is delivered. Always the bridesmaid. Mr. Peace becomes President of... Nothing at all. Age ninety-three. His arc reactor dims. Still dreaming of what could have been.
