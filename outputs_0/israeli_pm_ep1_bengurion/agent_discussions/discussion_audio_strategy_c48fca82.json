        "Voice Style: A powerful, commanding, yet slightly theatrical voice for Ben-Gurion, evoking a classic comic book hero. For key phrases like 'I am... INEVITABLE!', the delivery needs to be sharp, resonant, and delivered with significant impact. We'll use a neutral, energetic voice for any brief descriptive narration or for the 'editor's note'.",
        "Audio Approach: Prioritize short, punchy voiceover segments that are tightly synced with visual cues and on-screen text. For example, 'I am... INEVITABLE!' will be a standalone audio moment. The 'Editor's note box' and the 'Ben-Gurion will return...' teaser will be delivered as on-screen text synchronized with a distinct sound cue, rather than spoken dialogue, to save precious audio time.",
        "Sound Design: An aggressive, layered sound design is critical. This includes dramatic 'BOOM!', 'SNAP!', and 'KA-POW!' impacts that align perfectly with panel transitions and action. Motion lines will have subtle 'WHOOSH' effects. 'Kirby Dots energy' will be represented by a unique, electric sound. The 'sweat drops' will be accompanied by a subtle, almost comical 'plink' sound. The overall sonic landscape should feel energetic, slightly retro-comic, and incredibly impactful.",
