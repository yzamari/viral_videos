[VISUAL: Peter Griffin as a dragon treasure hunter, holding a treasure map] DIALOGUE: Alright, Stewie, we're finding treasure on this closed interval of the map! [VISUAL: A graph showing the treasure's elevation with Peter pointing to the highest and lowest points] DIALOGUE: The Extreme Value Theorem means the best and worst loot are always at the edges or humps. [VISUAL: Peter riding a dragon, showing its smooth, consistent velocity] DIALOGUE: This dragon's velocity is uniformly continuous; it does not suddenly teleport like a bad math problem. [VISUAL: A compass needle measuring the slope of a mountain] DIALOGUE: Derivatives are dragon velocity; they show our exact speed at any point on this crazy treasure hunt. [VISUAL: Peter smoothly sliding down a dragon's back, then a jagged graph showing a sharp corner] DIALOGUE: If a function is differentiable, it is continuous, unlike this bumpy dragon ride versus a smooth slide.
