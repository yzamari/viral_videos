A swelling orchestral score, transitioning from somber to hopeful, combined with subtle Foley for the magic and a poignant, character-driven narration will be key. The audio must perfectly synchronize with Rabin's emotional journey, the visual metamorphosis of swords to olive trees, and the climactic rainbow bridge, all within the critical 64-second window.",

Focusing on the 'pain and compassion' in his eyes and the symbolic transformations will create a powerful, shareable piece. The critical challenge is ensuring the audio syncs flawlessly with the rapid visual shifts and the escalating emotional arc of the music within the strict 64-second timeframe.",
