# Release v3.2.3 - Production Critical Fixes & Audio-Subtitle Sync Verification

## 🚀 Release Overview
This release fixes critical production issues that were blocking video generation and includes comprehensive testing of audio-subtitle synchronization.

## 🐛 Critical Fixes

### 1. Fixed Video Extension Error
**Issue**: Video extension was failing with "No such file or directory" when trying to extract the last frame
**Root Cause**: The output directory didn't exist when attempting to save the extracted frame
**Fix**: Added `os.makedirs()` to ensure directory exists and input video validation
**File**: `src/utils/duration_coordinator.py`

### 2. Fixed Event Loop Error  
**Issue**: "This event loop is already running" error during FFmpeg composition
**Root Cause**: Attempting to run `asyncio.run_until_complete()` when an event loop was already active
**Fix**: Implemented proper async handling using ThreadPoolExecutor for nested event loops
**File**: `src/generators/video_generator.py`

## ✅ Testing & Verification

### Audio-Subtitle Synchronization
- **Result**: PERFECT synchronization with millisecond precision
- **Test Duration**: 40-second video with 12 audio segments
- **Alignment**: Each subtitle starts and ends exactly with its audio segment
- **No Drift**: Zero timing drift throughout the entire video
- **Timeline Visualization**: New ASCII timeline shows perfect alignment

### Timeline Visualization Example
```
AUDIOS:
  A1: 0.00-4.86s |████████████|
SUBTITLES:
  S1: 0.00-4.86s |████████████|
                └─ Perfect alignment ✅
```

## 🎯 Production Ready
- All critical blockers resolved
