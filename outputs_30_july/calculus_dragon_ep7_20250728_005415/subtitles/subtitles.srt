1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,285
Functions are like transformation
machines.

2
00:00:02,285 --> 00:00:02,742
Input

3
00:00:03,042 --> 00:00:05,002
a roar, output a chair.

4
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:05,393
The

5
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,957
domain includes all possible inputs.

6
00:00:07,957 --> 00:00:08,410
The

7
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,296
range is only the outputs created.

8
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:14,862
One-to-one functions have one input for

9
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:16,145
each output.

10
00:00:16,145 --> 00:00:18,113
Onto functions use all

11
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:18,962
possible outputs;

12
00:00:18,962 --> 00:00:20,059
there are no leftovers.

13
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,068
Bijections are perfect one-to-one and onto

14
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:24,913
transformations.

15
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:27,634
Function composition chains
transformations together.

16
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:29,275
Even functions are symmetrical;

17
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:29,945
odd functions

18
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:31,617
are rotationally symmetrical.

19
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:32,988
Some functions repeat

20
00:00:33,288 --> 00:00:36,266
their output, like a broken record
