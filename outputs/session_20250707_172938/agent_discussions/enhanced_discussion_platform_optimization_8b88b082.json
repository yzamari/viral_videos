      "message": "For a 10-second comedy piece on YouTube, optimizing explicitly for Shorts is crucial, leveraging its vertical format and rapid consumption patterns. We must ensure the content delivers its comedic punch instantly to maximize watch-time percentage, which is a primary algorithmic signal for short-form video virality.",

        "Produce the video in a 9:16 aspect ratio to fit the YouTube Shorts player perfectly and facilitate seamless cross-platform adaptation to TikTok and Instagram Reels.",
        "Front-load the comedic premise and punchline within the first 2-3 seconds to capture attention immediately and maximize viewer retention for the entire 10-second duration.",
        "Utilize on-screen text overlays to enhance the humor or provide quick context, ensuring comprehension even with sound off, a common viewing behavior on short-form platforms.",
        "Integrate highly relevant hashtags such as #Shorts, #Comedy, #Unicorns, and specific tags related to the absurd premise to improve discoverability within the Shorts feed and search.",
        "Focus on high rewatchability through visual gags or a simple, repeatable joke that encourages viewers to loop the video multiple times."

        "Design the comedic climax or most absurd visual to hit within the first 3 seconds or as a sharp, unexpected twist at the 8-9 second mark for maximum impact and rewatch potential.",
        "Integrate a unique, meme-worthy visual or sound bite that encourages immediate social media sharing and discussion, acting as a 'pattern interrupt'.",
        "Leverage trending audio or create a distinct, highly memorable sound effect that becomes synonymous with the video's punchline, aiding discoverability and recognition.",
