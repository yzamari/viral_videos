00:00.000 --> 00:00.492
This just in:

00:00.492 --> 00:00.984
Tehran has gone

00:00.984 --> 00:02.016
full Mad Max.

00:02.016 --> 00:03.048
Peter Griffin-style warriors

00:03.048 --> 00:06.192
fight for the last water bottle.

00:06.192 --> 00:06.512
Witness me!

00:06.512 --> 00:07.152
This precious water is

00:07.152 --> 00:07.824
mine now.

00:07.824 --> 00:09.168
This reminds me of

00:09.168 --> 00:10.736
my novel about drought.

00:10.736 --> 00:11.520
Oh dear,

00:11.520 --> 00:13.824
I have been hit by a

00:13.824 --> 00:14.656
water truck.

00:14.656 --> 00:16.320
There is no water

00:16.320 --> 00:18.520
to wash my hijab anyway.

00:18.520 --> 00:18.960
It

00:18.960 --> 00:20.304
is a chicken fight out there

00:20.304 --> 00:20.880
with dehydration.

00:20.880 --> 00:21.456
Iran International:

00:21.456 --> 00:22.032
We are

00:22.032 --> 00:23.132
as thirsty as you are!

00:23.132 --> 00:23.352
Water

00:23.352 --> 00:23.504
apocalypse.

00:23.504 --> 00:23.960
This just in:

00:23.960 --> 00:24.264
Tehran has

00:24.264 --> 00:25.704
gone full Mad Max.

00:25.704 --> 00:26.424
Peter Griffin-style

00:26.424 --> 00:29.352
warriors fight for the last wat
