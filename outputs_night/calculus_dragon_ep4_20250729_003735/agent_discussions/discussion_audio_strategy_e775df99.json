        "For the title card, ensure the 'epic effects' translate to a thunderous, layered synth and orchestral score with a distinct 'e' powered hum that builds and then snaps into the title with a comical dragon roar or 'zap' sound.

For instance, monotonic sequences as an elevator where the dragon repeatedly tries to get to a higher floor, only to be reset to the current one with a funny reaction.
