    "reasoning": "Instagram's audience, particularly for entertainment content like Family Guy-style comedy, responds well to vibrant and eye-catching cartoon styles. This allows for exaggerated expressions, dynamic animation, and visual metaphors ('power transformations,' 'fractal magic') to be implemented effectively and accessibly. A cartoon style aligns with the 'fun' aspect and ensures the complex mathematical concepts are presented in an engaging, non-intimidating way. Vibrant colors will boost visual appeal on a platform like Instagram.",

For maximum impact and visibility without obstructing potential visual gags or important dialogue in a Family Guy style, the top center is the ideal position. It also aligns with general best practices for title cards on platforms like Instagram, ensuring it's prominent without being too intrusive.",

Create a Family Guy style comedy where baby dragon in power-up workshop teaches rational and real exponents, then explores topology. Cover fractional powers, real exponents as limits, accumulation points, isolated points, open and closed sets, interior and closure, and the Cantor set. Use visual metaphors: power transformations, dragon gatherings, bubble zones, fractal magic. Make topology concepts accessible and fun.",
