[VISUAL: Baby dragon, Sparky, with a tiny rocket pack ignites. He wobbles then zooms upwards.] DIALOGUE: Sparky's rocket pack is like a sequence; will it reach the stars or fizzle out? [VISUAL: Sparky blasts off, leaving a trail of sparks. A shrinking spell hits his rocket, but it keeps growing.] DIALOGUE: We test divergence with rocket launches! Even shrinking spells cannot stop its epic ascent. [VISUAL: Sparky passes a planet that looks like a giant number. The rocket's nose dips towards it.] DIALOGUE: Nth roots approaching one are like Sparky aiming for that planet, slowly but surely getting closer. [VISUAL: Sparky's rocket flies through a garden where plants grow super fast, but his rocket outpaces them. A 'Ratio Test' sign appears.] DIALOGUE: For growing plants, the ratio test shows rapid growth. Sparky's rocket engine has amazing growth rates! [VISUAL: Sparky lands triumphantly on the planet, which is now labeled 'Infinity'. A 'Root Test' sign appears near a large blooming flower.] DIALOGUE: The root test reveals growth rates too; Sparky's rocket found infinity. Sequences either converge, or have rocket-fueled divergence!
