The 64-second runtime allows for a powerful narrative arc, from the tactile, almost alchemical transformation of watches to time machines, to the ethereal visualization of peace negotiations.",

Each element, from the watch morph to the doves, needs a distinct, dreamlike Ghibli aesthetic, supported by an epic score, to resonate with the 'impossible dream' narrative within 64 seconds.",
