      "suggestions": [
        "For the title card, utilize bold typography and dynamic particle effects synced with a powerful sound sting to represent 'epic effects' and immediately signal high production value and entertainment value.",
        "Integrate visual demonstrations of recursion and mathematical concepts directly into the narrative; for instance, show the 'monotonic sequences' as physical staircases that the dragon ascends, with each step clearly labeled and moving in one direction."

      "suggestions": [
        "Create visually dynamic scenes for each mathematical concept. For monotonic sequences, show the dragon trying to get into an elevator that only goes up or down. For Bolzano-Weierstrass, have a quirky, wise guide always pointing Dragon in the right direction, even when he's confused.",

        "Incorporate quick cuts between the dragon's present and historical mathematician encounters. Visually represent the 'monotonic sequences' as a smooth, perhaps comical, elevator ride and 'nested intervals' as distinct, visually layered portals. The 'e' powered machine should look dynamic and central to the action."

      "suggestions": [
        "**Platform Optimization:** Prioritize vertical video format (9:16) for Reels and Stories. Ensure the first 15 seconds are incredibly captivating, showcasing the dragon's initial time-travel activation and a humorous interaction, to combat short attention spans. Use trending audio or create custom, catchy sound effects for key moments, especially the 'e'-powered machine activation and concept explanations.",
        "**Copy Strategy:** Craft Instagram captions that are intriguing and prompt engagement. Start with a hook like 'Math history just got WEIRD!' or 'Dragon time travels with... MATH?!' Use relevant hashtags like #mathtime #timetravel #dragon #comedy #mathisfun #recursive #familyguy #educationalcomedy #instagramreels. Encourage comments by asking questions like 'Which mathematician would you visit first?' or 'What other math concepts should the dragon explore?'",
        "**Thumbnail Design:** The thumbnail should feature a dynamic image of the dragon looking amazed or confused, with a clear visual representation of the 'e' powered time machine. Incorporate a hint of the animated title card's epic feel, perhaps with a subtle glow or motion blur effect. Text overlay should be minimal and impactful, like 'DRAGON MATH TIME WARP!'",
        "**Algorithm Alignment:** To align with Instagram's algorithm, focus on maximizing watch time and completion rate. This means keeping the pacing brisk, with rapid cuts between humorous encounters and clear, concise explanations of mathematical concepts. Encourage saves and shares by providing genuine value (humor + learning) that viewers will want to revisit or pass on."

        "The 'Unknown Duration' is a critical concern for Instagram. While the content is rich, it needs to be segmented or edited for shorter formats (Reels, Stories) to maintain audience retention. If it's a longer piece, breaking it into multiple digestible parts will be key.",
        "Balancing the 'Family Guy' comedic tone with accurate, yet simplified, mathematical explanations is crucial. Over-complication or excessive silliness could alienate viewers or diminish the educational value, impacting shareability."
