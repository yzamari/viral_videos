[VISUAL: Peter Griffin piloting a ridiculously oversized dragon through the sky] DIALOGUE: Alright Lois, see this smooth flight path? That is a limit. We get closer and closer without actually hitting the destination. [VISUAL: Dragon suddenly teleports forward instead of flying] DIALOGUE: Now, if the dragon just blinked out of existence and reappeared, that is not a limit. That is just rude teleporting, Brian. [VISUAL: Dragon attempts to land from the left and right simultaneously, crashing] DIALOGUE: We land from the left, we land from the right. Both directions must agree, or the whole operation is continuity chaos. [VISUAL: Dragon lands perfectly, smoothly descending to the ground] DIALOGUE: See that perfect landing? No sudden jolts! That is continuity, folks. The flight function is smooth all the way down. [VISUAL: Dragon dips and weaves, reaching a target altitude] DIALOGUE: Even when we change altitude, the flight never breaks. It is all connected, like Stewieâ€™s evil plans, but with more math.
