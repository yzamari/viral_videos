The \"Family Guy\" style comedy should be woven into the zero-gravity demonstrations and dragon's jokes, with clear, concise visual explanations of the convergence tests.  For Instagram's \"unknown duration\" format, we should aim for a digestible, episodic feel, potentially breaking down complex math into micro-learnings within the overarching comedic narrative to drive watch time and shares.",

The 3-second animated title card must be visually arresting to capture immediate attention, and the math explanations need to be integrated seamlessly with the comedy and visual gags for maximum engagement.",

The Family Guy-esque humor should be delivered through rapid-fire jokes and relatable character interactions with the dragon astronaut, interspersed with dynamic zero-gravity visual gags that clearly illustrate the math concepts. Each math demonstration needs to be a self-contained, visually arresting segment that can stand alone but also contribute to the episode's narrative arc, ensuring watchability even if viewed out of order.",

Leveraging the 'Unknown Duration' of Instagram's format means crafting content that is highly rewatchable and shareable, perhaps with easily digestible 'math moments' within the narrative.",
