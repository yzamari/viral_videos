00:00.000 --> 00:02.304
Hey kids, I am Epsilon the

00:02.304 --> 00:02.384
Dragon!

00:02.384 --> 00:02.464
POOF!

00:02.464 --> 00:02.784
Natural numbers magically appear

00:02.784 --> 00:05.264
as delicious counting cookies.

00:05.264 --> 00:06.504
But wait!

00:06.504 --> 00:07.152
Integers arrive with a shiver,
representing

00:07.152 --> 00:08.440
negative temperatures.

00:08.440 --> 00:09.084
WHOOSH!

00:09.084 --> 00:11.016
Rational numbers flutter

00:11.016 --> 00:11.520
down as perfectly sized pizza slices.

00:11.520 --> 00:12.784
Mind blown!

00:12.784 --> 00:15.312
Irrational numbers are like

00:15.312 --> 00:15.952
infinite, shimmering dragons, stretching
endlessly.

00:15.952 --> 00:16.080
Real

00:16.080 --> 00:20.424
numbers create a beautiful, complete
number

00:20.424 --> 00:20.960
line.

00:20.960 --> 00:23.640
Absolute value is a warm

00:23.640 --> 00:26.056
dragon hug, always positive.

00:26.056 --> 00:27.264
Intervals are

00:27.264 --> 00:30.000
cozy nap zones on the number

00:30.000 --> 00:30.452
line.

00:30.452 --> 00:32.712
Bounded sets are snug, secure

00:32.712 --> 00:33.160
cages.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.400
Supremum is the tallest dragon

00:35.400 --> 00:36.876
in the land!

00:36.876 --> 00:38.352
Completeness ensures there

00:38.352 --> 00:41.880
are no gaps on our number

00:41.880 --> 00:41.966
line.

00:41.966 --> 00:42.826
My little Epsilon chicks chirp, "Epsilon
is greater than zero!

00:42.826 --> 00:42.912
"
