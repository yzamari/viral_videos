Stewie's stuck on infinite stairs, realizing he is climbing a monotonic sequence. He gets stuck in time loops, his recursive sequences repeating endlessly. He learns about number 'e' and nested intervals, like shrinking Russian dolls. Subsequences appear, tiny versions of the journey, hinting at Bolzano-Weierstrass. A bounded monotonic sequence must converge, even if the stairs never end! Stewie's stuck on infinite stairs, realiz
