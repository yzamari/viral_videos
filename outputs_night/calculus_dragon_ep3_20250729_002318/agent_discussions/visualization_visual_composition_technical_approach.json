The 'Family Guy' style animation should be leveraged for exaggerated physics and comedic reactions during zero-gravity demonstrations and math games, making the abstract concepts visually digestible and entertaining.",

The 'Family Guy' animation style allows for visually exaggerated math demonstrations. Each concept needs a distinct, memorable visual gag and a concise explanation. The 40-second limit demands we keep each of the three tests and their explanations to around 7-9 seconds, including the title card and intro.",

The 3-second title card needs a powerful, attention-grabbing soundscape. Each math demonstration should have distinct, playful sound effects that enhance the visual gags and mathematical concepts, ensuring clarity and humor within the 40-second limit.",
