    "reasoning": "The prompt explicitly mentions 'Family Guy news breakdown,' 'Meg-style teenager,' and 'Cleveland-style IT minister,' all direct references to distinct cartoon animation styles. The humor is derived from exaggerated situations and visual gags (smeared makeup, smoke signals, pigeons with USBs) which are best conveyed through animation. A vibrant color palette will complement the energetic and often satirical nature of this type of content on YouTube.",

    "reasoning": "The request specifies 'YouTube' as the platform, which generally benefits from a lower third safe zone for text overlays like the 'Lower third: \"COMING UP: How to Like Things Without a Button\"'. Positioning it at the bottom center ensures this text is prominent and adheres to common YouTube overlay practices. Other visual elements are described as dynamic and can be placed around this static overlay.",
