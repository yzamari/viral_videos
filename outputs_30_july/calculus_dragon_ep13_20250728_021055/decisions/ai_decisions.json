    "reasoning": "For Instagram, avoiding the bottom 20% is crucial to prevent the overlay from being cut off or obscured by UI elements like the like/comment/share buttons, or the user's profile info. Placing it at the top center provides a clear viewing area for the content and the overlay title while remaining visible. It's a safe and effective placement for static text.",
