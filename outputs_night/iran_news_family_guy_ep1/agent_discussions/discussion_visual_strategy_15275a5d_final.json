    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Implement the Iran International logo and professional news graphics with high fidelity to establish the news format immediately, juxtaposing it with Maryam's character design and the humorous premise.  Tag: [VISUAL: Iran International logo top-right, professional news overlay graphic begins, Maryam as Persian Lois Griffin with hijab and huge eyes at a news desk], Execute the 'ghosted water' visual with dynamic, exaggerated animation of water droplets carrying suitcases, creating a strong, memorable image.  Tag: [VISUAL: Cartoon map of Iran with water droplets running away with suitcases], Ensure the Peter Griffin-style official's delivery is deadpan and perfectly timed for maximum comedic effect, immediately after the water droplet visual. Tag: [VISUAL: Peter Griffin-style official appears] DIALOGUE: Water? Never heard of her.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is ensuring the visual complexity of the animated map with fleeing water droplets and the professional news graphics doesn't overwhelm the screen or slow down the rapid pacing required for a 40-second YouTube short.",
      "A primary concern is ensuring the animation quality of the water droplets with suitcases is clear and humorous, not just abstract movement, to fully convey the gag.  Also, ensuring Maryam's character design, while referencing Lois Griffin, maintains the 'Persian' and 'hijab' elements clearly and respectfully within the comedic context.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the detailed professional news overlay graphics with the Family Guy animation style. We must ensure neither element looks out of place, and that the animation quality supports the satire without becoming overly complex, which could slow down the pacing."

      "Allocate approximately 5-7 seconds for the opening, featuring the Iran International logo, Maryam's initial 'ghosted water' report, and the animated map of Iran with fleeing water droplets.

It left no forwarding address.",
      "Dedicate 8-10 seconds to the Peter Griffin-style official's line and the 'Water Crisis' ticker, immediately followed by the citizens licking dew.

      "Conclude the final 10-12 seconds with the lower third graphic for the dew-licking tutorial, maintaining a brisk pace to hit the 40-second mark. [VISUAL: Lower third reads 'EXCLUSIVE: Dew Licking Tutorial at 11'.]",
      "The viral potential hinges on the unexpectedness of the premise and the strong visual humor; ensure the animation quality supports the professional news overlay without sacrificing the Family Guy aesthetic.",
      "Conclude with the lower third and a brief visual of citizens licking dew to reinforce the joke and hint at the tutorial. Tag: [VISUAL: Citizens licking morning dew.] DIALOGUE: Our exclusive dew licking tutorial airs at 11."
