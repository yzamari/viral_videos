    "reasoning": "The prompt uses strong, exaggerated imagery and punchy descriptions reminiscent of comic book storytelling (medals like Infinity Stones, brain glows, Hulk rampage, Thanos snap). A comic style would effectively capture this tone and visual language. Vibrant colors align with the energetic and dramatic nature of the content, aiming for high engagement on Instagram.",

    "reasoning": "Instagram's recommendation to avoid the bottom 20% suggests that placing the overlay in the bottom center, but not too low, will keep it visible without being obscured by common UI elements like the like/comment bar. This position also allows for good readability across a variety of visual content.",

Dressed as woman in operation flashback - 'I understood gender fluidity before it was cool.' Coalition crumbles faster than Thanos snap. Loses to Sharon in biggest landslide ever. Later: Epstein's island cameo, 'I kept my underwear on!' Apartment in luxury tower: 'I'm watching you... from above.'",
