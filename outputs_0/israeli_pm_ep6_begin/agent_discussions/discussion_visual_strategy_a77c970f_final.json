    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Utilize distinct visual filters and animation styles for each major emotional shift. For example, the 'WANTED' posters and initial rise could use a gritty, ink-heavy comic style, while the 'Depression spiral' employs distorted perspectives and glitch effects, mirroring Thor's breakdown. The 'Wakanda-style' meeting should incorporate vibrant, abstract geometric patterns overlaid on historical footage for a unique visual fusion., Implement a strong, evolving audio landscape to guide the narrative. Begin with an empowering, anthemic score that shifts dramatically to chaotic, dissonant sounds during the 'Lebanon War Chaos' and 'Depression Spiral' sequences, underscoring the psychological breakdown. The 'Cave Hermit' segment should feature stark silence or a low, guttural hum, amplifying the isolation and despair before the unnerving ambient track for the post-credit scene., Utilize bold, high-contrast comic art styles for each section, with clear, stylized text for thought bubbles and captions to ensure readability and aesthetic cohesion. For the 'WANTED' posters, incorporate subtle animation like fluttering edges. The Camp David scene needs a 'Wakanda-style' graphic overlay for an epic feel, while the peace signing will feature slow-motion panels with exaggerated 'FLUTTER!' sound effects for the stylized dove wings.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Maintaining visual coherence and brand identity across such diverse visual styles (historical reenactment, abstract animation, comic book panels) within a tight timeline without appearing jarring or losing the epic feel will be a significant technical challenge.",
      "The primary concern is the sheer density of narrative progression within 65 seconds. Ensuring each transition feels natural and impactful without rushing the emotional weight of the 'dark turn' and 'depression spiral' will be critical. Overcrowding visuals or dialogue could dilute the message.",
      "The primary concern is maintaining clarity and emotional impact across such diverse visual and narrative shifts within the tight 65-second timeframe. Cramming too much detail or too many rapid cuts could lead to viewer fatigue or a loss of the intended narrative progression and emotional weight.",
      "The primary concern is balancing the density of the narrative with the need for clear, digestible segments on Instagram. Cramming too much visual information or too many distinct plot points into short segments could dilute the impact and lead to viewer confusion. Ensuring subtitles are concise and readable within the rapid pace is crucial."

      "For the 'Lebanon War Chaos' and 'Depression Spiral' segments, employ jarring visual glitches, rapid cuts, and distorted audio to convey the loss of control and internal turmoil, directly mirroring the 'Thor-like breakdown' and the melting Nobel Prize. The 'Cave Hermit' scene will shift to stark black and white with minimal, echoing sound design to emphasize isolation, before the post-credit map segment uses a creeping, unsettling ambient track with animated, growing settlement markers.",

      "For the 'Lebanon War Chaos' and 'Depression spiral' segments, utilize jarring sound effects like static, distorted vocalizations, and rapid tempo changes in the score to amplify the sense of breakdown and loss of control, synced precisely with the visual montage.",
      "Visually represent the 'First they ignore you...' thought bubble with a bold, stylized comic font over swirling 'WANTED' posters, underscored by a gritty, driving beat to establish immediate defiance."

      "To accomplish this Marvel Comics epic on Instagram within 65 seconds, we will employ a rapid-fire, visually dynamic approach. Each narrative beat will be compressed into 5-7 second segments, using striking comic book panel aesthetics and impactful transitions. The visual strategy will focus on high contrast, bold colors, and exaggerated action to convey the emotional arc from defiance to despair, culminating in a chillingly effective post-credit sequence that leaves a lasting impression.",
      "To achieve the 'Marvel Comics epic: UNDERGROUND PANEL!' on Instagram within 65 seconds, we'll employ a hyper-visual, emotionally resonant strategy. We'll compress the narrative into tightly edited, impactful comic-style panels, using dynamic motion graphics and a strong, evolving soundscape to guide the viewer through a powerful arc of defiance, hope, chaos, and grim realization. This approach will maximize emotional impact and memorability within the platform's constraints, effectively delivering the mission's cautionary message.",
      "To achieve the 'Marvel Comics epic: UNDERGROUND PANEL!' narrative on Instagram within 65 seconds, we must strategically sequence impactful, short visual segments (5-8 seconds each) with clear, concise subtitles and an evolving soundscape that mirrors the emotional arc. The 'WANTED' poster and thought bubble segments will establish defiance, followed by a 'Wakanda-style' dynamic for the Camp David summit and a visually arresting, slow-motion peace signing. The descent into chaos will be conveyed through rapid cuts, distorted audio, and a 'Thor-like breakdown' sequence, culminating in the Nobel Prize melting and a stark 'cave hermit' scene to drive home the 'terrorist to peacemaker to...' narrative, ending with a chilling, subtly escalating soundscape for the symbiote-like map."
