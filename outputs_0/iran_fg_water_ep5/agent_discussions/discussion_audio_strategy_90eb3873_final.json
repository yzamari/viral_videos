    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Implement highly exaggerated 'Mad Max' style grunts, impacts, and a distorted 'WITNESS ME!' with heavy reverb. The water truck impact should be a sudden, jarring sonic assault cutting off Brian's intellectual musings., Craft Maryam's voice acting with a progression from stressed urgency to defiant resignation, culminating in her final line. A subtle, arid soundscape with occasional dry coughs or wind could underscore the 'thirsty' theme throughout., Emphasize heavy reverb and guttural shouts for the 'Peter Griffin-style warriors' and a distinct, jarring impact sound for the water truck to maximize comedic surprise and visual linkage.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is ensuring the quick succession of dialogue and sound effects for each comedic beat precisely fits within the 60-second timeframe without any lag that could disrupt the pacing or comedic flow.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring the transitions between Maryam's reporting and the various cutaways are seamless and timed to perfection to avoid disrupting the comedic flow, especially given the tight timing requirements for each gag.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring that the rapid succession of comedic beats and dialogue, especially the cutaways, are precisely timed to fit within the 60-second \u00b15% window without feeling rushed or losing their comedic impact."

      "Craft Maryam's dialogue with subtle audio cues reflecting her disheveled state before her final line, perhaps a strained breath or a sigh, to enhance the impact of her absurd resignation. Ensure the final Persian title card has a dry, atmospheric sound bed with a single, echoing water drop to reinforce the 'thirsty' theme."
