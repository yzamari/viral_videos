        "Technically, the 'juggling multiple corruption trials while texting' needs a clear, quick visual gag; perhaps a montage of phone screens with flashing notifications alongside Netanyahu performing the action. Similarly, the 'coalition deals with exploding panels' could be represented by animated, shattering graphics of agreements or documents."
