    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Utilize distinct, almost cartoonish sound effects for each action (CRASH, WHOOSH, BOOM, ZAP, THWACK, CRACK, WHAM) and ensure the dialogue 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' are delivered with heroic, slightly exaggerated intonation., Segment the video into very short, ~1-2 second visual and audio beats for each described action to maintain a rapid pace and hit the 35-second mark without feeling rushed., Allocate distinct, short audio cues (0.5-1 second) for each onomatopoeia (CRASH, WHOOSH, BOOM, ZAP, THWACK, CRACK, WHAM), ensuring they are punchy and distinct, with the voiceover carefully timed to land immediately after or slightly before the effect for maximum impact. For example, 'CRASH!' sound effect followed immediately by the 'I am eternal!' dialogue.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is ensuring all the individual actions and sound cues are clearly distinguishable and impactful within the 35-second limit. There's a risk of sound muddiness if effects are not carefully mixed and timed, especially given the density of events like 'juggling multiple corruption trials while texting' and 'building settlements with energy beams'.",
      "The primary concern is fitting the sheer density of described actions and sound cues into the tight 35-second timeframe without audio muddiness or visual incoherence, which could dilute the intended Marvel-style impact.",
      "The primary concern is fitting the dense narrative with numerous distinct actions and sound cues into the tight 35-second window without it feeling rushed or losing clarity, which could detract from the desired Marvel-style impact."

    "recommended_actions": [
      "Segment the video into very short, ~1-2 second visual and audio beats for each described action to maintain a rapid pace and hit the 35-second mark without feeling rushed.",
      "Utilize distinct, almost cartoonish sound effects for each action (CRASH, WHOOSH, BOOM, ZAP, THWACK, CRACK, WHAM) and ensure the dialogue 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' are delivered with heroic, slightly exaggerated intonation.",
      "Allocate distinct, short audio cues (0.5-1 second) for each onomatopoeia (CRASH, WHOOSH, BOOM, ZAP, THWACK, CRACK, WHAM), ensuring they are punchy and distinct, with the voiceover carefully timed to land immediately after or slightly before the effect for maximum impact. For example, 'CRASH!' sound effect followed immediately by the 'I am eternal!' dialogue.",
      "The voice style should be an energetic, slightly over-the-top narrator, embodying a classic comic book announcer, delivering key phrases like 'I am eternal!' and 'Bibi will return... again!' with dramatic flair to enhance the overall thematic coherence.",
      "Segment the script into very short visual/audio chunks, ensuring each 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!' has a distinct visual and sound effect, each lasting no more than 1-2 seconds, to capture the essence of the comic book action.",
      "Layer the 'juggling multiple corruption trials while texting' segment with a rapid succession of quick, subtle 'zip' or 'ding' sounds akin to text notifications, underscoring the action without overwhelming the primary soundscape. The 'judicial reform controversy splits the nation' can be emphasized with a sharp, dramatic 'CRACK!' sound effect."
