00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,214
Greetings, fledgling mathematicians!

2
00:00:01,214 --> 00:00:02,429
Today, we explore

3
00:00:02,729 --> 00:00:05,097
natural numbers, counting cookies.

4
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:06,282
A mishap

5
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:06,865
occurs;

6
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:08,279
we encounter integers, including negative

7
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,098
numbers.

8
00:00:09,098 --> 00:00:11,688
For pizza slices, we need

9
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:14,705

00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:16,063
Beware irrational

11
00:00:16,363 --> 00:00:17,656
numbers like pi;

12
00:00:17,656 --> 00:00:18,949
they are infinite.

13
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:20,555
All these numbers form the real

14
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:25,139
number line, a universe of possibilities
