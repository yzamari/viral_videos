    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Prioritize aggressive sound layering: Ensure 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!' are distinct, impactful, and clearly synchronized with their visual counterparts to mimic a Marvel comic's energy., Optimize visual pacing for Instagram Reels: Each event, from Netanyahu crashing through walls to juggling trials, needs a quick, impactful visual representation with accompanying sound, keeping the audience engaged and anticipating the next action within the ~35-second target., Allocate roughly 3-4 seconds per distinct action or dialogue piece to hit the 35-second mark, factoring in quick crossfades. For example, '[VISUAL: Netanyahu in lightning aura crashes through Knesset] CRASH! 'I am eternal!' [VISUAL: Opposition parties turn to comic smoke] WHOOSH!' could be about 4-5 seconds.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "The primary concern is fitting all the distinct events and dialogue into the 35-second window without sacrificing visual clarity or the impact of the sound design. We need to be ruthless with cutting any extraneous seconds.",
      "The primary concern is achieving the precise timing for each of the rapid-fire events. If any segment runs long, it could push the total duration outside the acceptable 33.25-36.75 second range, disrupting the flow and potentially failing duration compliance.",
      "The primary concern is ensuring that the sheer number of distinct events described (Knesset crash, vanishing opposition, exploding panels, juggling trials, settlements, judicial reform, repeated return) can be visually represented and rhythmically paced within the tight 35-second timeframe without feeling rushed or incoherent."
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
      "Allocate approximately 2-3 seconds per key action/dialogue snippet (e.g., 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!') to ensure all elements are covered within the 35-second window, with minimal buffer.",
      "Emphasize bold, comic-style sound effects that align with the visual punches. The 'CRASH!', 'WHOOSH!', 'BOOM!', 'ZAP!', 'THWACK!', 'CRACK!', and 'WHAM!' are crucial for conveying the Marvel vibe and must be timed precisely with their corresponding visuals.",
      "Visually map each event (Knesset crash, vanishing opposition, exploding panels, texting, energy beams, flag) to a distinct, impactful frame that is quickly replaced by the next, creating a fast-paced, comic-style panel transition.",
      "Allocate roughly 3-4 seconds per distinct action or dialogue piece to hit the 35-second mark, factoring in quick crossfades. For example, '[VISUAL: Netanyahu in lightning aura crashes through Knesset] CRASH! 'I am eternal!' [VISUAL: Opposition parties turn to comic smoke] WHOOSH!' could be about 4-5 seconds.",

    "consensus_points": [
      "For the 'Marvel Comics explosion!' theme focusing on Benjamin Netanyahu, we need a rapid-fire, visually dynamic approach on Instagram.

      "To maximize engagement for this 'Marvel Comics explosion!' theme on Instagram, we need to ensure each of the action-packed visual cues and dialogue snippets are punchy and extremely brief.
