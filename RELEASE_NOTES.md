# Release Notes

## v3.2.3 (July 29, 2025)

### üö® Critical Production Fixes

#### RTL Text Double Reversal Fix
- **ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: MoviePy was applying RTL handling on already-reversed text

- **Fixed**: Processing delays causing misalignment

#### Ghibli Animation Style Fix
- **Enhanced**: Style description now emphasizes "2D hand-drawn animation"
- **Added**: Specific Miyazaki aesthetic keywords
- **Result**: Proper Japanese anime style instead of realistic rendering

#### Failed Video Generation Prevention
- **Added**: Emergency fallback when all generation methods fail
- **Prevents**: "base_video.mp4 not found" errors
- **Ensures**: Pipeline completion even in worst-case scenarios

### üìö Documentation

## v3.2.2 (July 28, 2025)

### üé¨ Major Video Generation Fixes

#### RTL Text Rendering
- **Fixed Hebrew/Arabic text reversal**: Text now displays correctly using `arabic-reshaper` and `python-bidi`
- **Proper bidirectional text support**: Hebrew subtitles no longer appear reversed (◊ñ◊ß◊ü instead of ◊ü◊ß◊ñ)
- **Automatic RTL detection**: System detects RTL languages and applies proper text shaping
- **Fallback support**: Graceful degradation if RTL libraries unavailable

#### Animation Style Recognition 
- **Fixed Ghibli style detection**: Enhanced style matching for complex style strings
- **Proper style enhancement**: "studio ghibli magical realism" now correctly applies Ghibli animation
- **Improved style mapping**: Better partial matching for animation styles

#### Audio-Subtitle Synchronization
- **Perfect timing alignment**: Replaced overlapping audio with proper silence gaps
- **Sequential audio playback**: Audio segments now play at exact subtitle timings
- **Dynamic silence insertion**: Calculates and inserts precise silence between segments
- **End-of-video padding**: Added proper silence at video end to match duration

### üîß Technical Implementation
- Added RTL text reshaping in `video_generator.py` for all subtitle rendering
- Enhanced `visual_style_agent.py` style detection algorithm
- Rewrote audio concatenation logic with proper gap calculation
- Added `fix_rtl_rendering.py` utility for RTL package installation
