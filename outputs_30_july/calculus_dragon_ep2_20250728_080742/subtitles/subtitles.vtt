00:00.000 --> 00:01.998
Prepare for the Sequence Dragon Express!

00:01.998 --> 00:02.664
Our magical

00:02.964 --> 00:08.006
train, full of sequences, is hijacked by
epsilon-delta

00:08.306 --> 00:08.662
bandits.

00:08.662 --> 00:11.153
They throw math obstacles at the brave

00:11.453 --> 00:12.022
dragon.

00:12.022 --> 00:15.999
Dragon blasts through epsilon tunnels with
fiery

00:16.299 --> 00:18.356
breath, dodging obstacles.

00:18.356 --> 00:21.784
Using bounded sequences as shields,

00:22.084 --> 00:25.696
the dragon valiantly fights the
convergence villains.

00:25.696 --> 00:26.212
With

00:26.512 --> 00:27.975
the Squeeze Theorem as its weapon, the
dragon

00:28.275 --> 00:28.582
fights bravely.

00:28.582 --> 00:29.042
Victory is near!

00:29.042 --> 00:29.502
Limits are conquered
