00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Alright Lois, see this smooth flight

2
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:08,096
path That is a limit We approach the destination without actually reaching

3
00:00:08,397 --> 00:00:12,237
it If the dragon vanished and

4
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:17,765
reappeared, that is not a limit; it is rude teleporting, Brian.

5
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:22,515
We land from the left, we land

6
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:26,588
from the right Both directions must match, or the operation is chaotic.

7
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:29,687
See that perfect landing No sudden jolts That is continuity.

8
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:34,255
The flight is smooth Even with altitude changes,

9
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:38,734
the flight remains unbroken It is all connected, like Stewie's evil plans, but with more precision
