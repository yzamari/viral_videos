    "positioning_strategy": "static",
    "reasoning": "For Instagram, avoiding the bottom 20% is key to ensure the overlay doesn't get cut off by the UI elements. Bottom center is a safe and visible placement that allows the cartoon visuals to dominate the majority of the screen without obstruction, while still being easily readable.",
