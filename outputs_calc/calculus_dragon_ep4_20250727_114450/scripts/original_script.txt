Behold, the baby dragon on an infinite staircase!  Monotonic means always up or always down. This dragon is never falling off!  Bounded plus monotonic equals convergent. Look, the dragon is stuck in a time loop!  Recursive sequences mean next term depends on previous. We can find the limits of these recursive sequences.  It is like the dragon's journey. The number e appears: Natural dragon growth!  This is a key mathematical constant. Here is Cantor's lemma with nested dragon boxes!  Each box is smaller than the last. Subsequences are like dragon cousins.  They are related but distinct. Bolzano-Weierstrass states: Every bounded sequence has a convergent cousin!  The dragon always finds a way.
