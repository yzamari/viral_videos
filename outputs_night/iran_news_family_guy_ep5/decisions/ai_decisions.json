    "reasoning": "The prompt describes a 'Family Guy' news apocalypse, immediately suggesting a comedic and exaggerated cartoon style. The specific character references (Brian-style scientist, Herbert-style elder) further solidify this.

    "reasoning": "The request specifies a YouTube platform with a cartoon style and a duration of 40 seconds. The 'lower third' is a common and effective placement for news tickers and informational text on YouTube, fitting the 'news' aspect of the scene. Placing it at the bottom center ensures it's visible without obscuring key visual elements and adheres to YouTube's lower third safe zone recommendations. The static positioning is appropriate for this type of content.",
