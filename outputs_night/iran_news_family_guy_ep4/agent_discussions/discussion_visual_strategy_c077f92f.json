Prioritize clear audio separation for each character., Time the 'Pigeons carrying USB drives' cutaway to be brief yet impactful, and synchronize the news ticker text with a subtle, driving sound effect. The studio lights flickering should be timed with a sharp audio cue, like a glitch or hum, preceding Maryam's flask drink., The lower third graphic should appear and disappear with a soft 'whoosh' sound, subtly reinforcing the upcoming segment without distracting from the core news.",

The pigeon cutaway should be a quick, absurd visual gag, and the news ticker needs to be easily readable but fleeting.",

The flickering studio lights should be accompanied by a sharp, glitchy sound effect that perfectly syncs with the visual cue, leading directly into Maryam's flask sip with a subtle 'glug' sound for comedic effect.
