    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Segment the script into approximately 8-10 distinct audio/visual moments, assigning specific sound effects and voiceover snippets to each, ensuring a total duration within the 61.75-68.25 second window. Each segment will be around 6-7 seconds., Prioritize high-impact sound design. Use a powerful 'BOOM' for Ben-Gurion's emergence, a sharp 'SNAP' for the Mandate's disappearance, and a 'KA-POW' for key declarations. Incorporate 'Kirby Dots' sound effects for the tech panels to evoke classic comic book visuals. The 'WHOOSH' for yoga should be subtle yet energetic., The voiceover for Ben-Gurion's lines ('I am... INEVITABLE!', 'Finally, peace.') should be authoritative and impactful, mimicking a classic comic narrator. The final teaser and editor's note should have a slightly more playful, 'Easter egg' tone.",
    "key_considerations": [
      "Ensuring smooth and impactful transitions between the numerous comic panels within the tight timeframe is crucial to avoid a choppy or confusing viewing experience.",
      "The primary concern is achieving the precise timing for each 'panel' and sound effect. A slight over- or under-run in any segment can impact the overall duration and the narrative flow, potentially pushing us outside the 5% tolerance. This requires meticulous editing and audio mixing.",
      "Maintaining Clarity within Brevity: The primary challenge will be to convey the complex narrative of nation-building and Ben-Gurion's actions clearly and compellingly within such a short, action-packed format. Overly complex visuals or dialogue could dilute the message."

      "Segment Timing Allocation: Break down the 65-second target into approximately 8-second segments for each key action described in the mission, allowing for quick transitions and visual effects like 'BOOM!' and 'SNAP!' to occupy a brief 1-2 seconds each.",
      "The voiceover for Ben-Gurion's lines ('I am... INEVITABLE!', 'Finally, peace.') should be authoritative and impactful, mimicking a classic comic narrator. The final teaser and editor's note should have a slightly more playful, 'Easter egg' tone.",
      "Allocate approximately 7-8 seconds for the opening 'BOOM!' and Ben-Gurion's desert emergence, including the 'I AM... INEVITABLE!' speech bubble."
