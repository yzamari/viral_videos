Ensure voiceovers for key phrases like 'I am... INEVITABLE!' are sharp and impactful., For the 'WHOOSH!' yoga headstand segment, utilize dynamic motion graphics with subtle whooshing sound effects and a brief, focused moment of dialogue to emphasize concentration amidst chaos. This allows for a brief pause in the high-octane action while still conveying character and activity., Allocate approximately 6-8 seconds per major action panel described in the mission (e.g., 'BOOM! David Ben-Gurion bursts from desert sands,' 'SNAP! British Mandate vanishes,' 'KA-POW! Declaring independence,' 'WHOOSH! Yoga headstands'). This provides a framework for precise timing.",
