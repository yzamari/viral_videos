We must ensure the sound design for the epic title card is impactful and that the math explanations, delivered through the dragon character, are clear and punchy with appropriate comedic sound effects to keep viewers hooked.",

The combination of a Family Guy-esque comedy with complex math concepts requires careful pacing and audio cues to maintain engagement and ensure the math is understandable without being overwhelming. Focusing on the 'epic effects' for the title card and the 'dragon's space jokes' will be crucial for virality.",
      "suggestions": [
        "Prioritize a high-energy, layered audio track for the 3-second title card, featuring whooshes, orchestral swells, and perhaps a comedic dragon roar, immediately setting the tone.",
        "Ensure the dragon's voice is modulated with a fun, slightly exaggerated tone, and complement each math demonstration with distinct, playful sound effects (e.g., boing for a bouncing rocket, growing sounds for a plant).",
        "Design the audio for zero-gravity demonstrations to include subtle, airy effects and perhaps distorted voiceovers to enhance the comedic absurdity.",
        "We need to develop short, memorable sound bites for the dragon's jokes that can be easily replayed or referenced in comments, boosting engagement."

The 'Family Guy' style comedy and space theme provide a strong hook, but the math needs to be integrated seamlessly without overwhelming the viewer.

        "Ensure the 3-second animated title card features impactful, meme-able visuals and sound design that immediately grabs attention and hints at the comedic math content.",
        "Break down each convergence test demonstration into very short, visually distinct segments (e.g., 5-7 seconds each) with a clear punchline or visual gag related to infinity.",
        "Incorporate quick cuts and dynamic camera movements during the zero-gravity math demonstrations to enhance the 'space comedy' feel and keep viewers visually stimulated.",
