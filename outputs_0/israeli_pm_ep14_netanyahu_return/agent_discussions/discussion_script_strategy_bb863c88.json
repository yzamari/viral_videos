        "The corruption trial segment should use close-ups of accumulating 'scandal stones' (represented visually as gems or similar) with subtle clinking sounds, accompanied by imagery of cigars, champagne, and media frenzy.",
        "For COVID panels, use a 'I SAVED Israel!' text overlay on a distorted or chaotic visual, juxtaposed with shots of raging protests outside to create a sense of conflict and urgency.",

        "Transition into the 'Coalition JUGGLING' with visual metaphors of dropping balls and a chaotic crash, followed by the 'Back in 2022!' line and a 'WINK!' from Netanyahu.",
        "The 'KING BIBI' crumbling panel should be a dramatic visual of a crown turning to ash, signifying the perceived downfall, timed with the 'CRASH!' audio cue.",
