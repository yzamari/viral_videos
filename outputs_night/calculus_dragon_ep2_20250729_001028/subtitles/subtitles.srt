00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,795
Welcome aboard the Sequence Dragon
Express!

2
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:05,785
Each car holds a term approaching its
limit.

3
00:00:06,085 --> 00:00:11,545
Epsilon and Delta, our expert inspectors,
ensure everything remains within bounds.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,804
Next stop, convergence!

5
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:17,082
Watch these terms draw closer to their
destination.

6
00:00:17,382 --> 00:00:19,864
Observe the Squeeze Theorem in action;

7
00:00:20,164 --> 00:00:24,369
parallel tracks merge beautifully,
mirroring our converging sequences.

8
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:29,528
For safety, we rely on bounded sequences,
our dependable safety rails.

9
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:31,787
Hold on tight, everyone!

10
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:34,020
