The music should be a sweeping, orchestral piece that swells during dramatic reveals and fades subtly under dialogue, building to a powerful crescendo during the quote.",
        "Sound Design: Implement subtle wind effects that ebb and flow, enhancing the 'mystical winds' visual. For the 'glowing tunnels,' use a low-frequency hum or ethereal sound that suggests ancient power and history. The 'stone tablets' could be accompanied by a soft, resonant 'chime' or a faint whisper of ancient text as they appear and fade, adding to the Ghibli-esque enchantment. The overall audio mix must balance these elements to maintain clarity and impact."
