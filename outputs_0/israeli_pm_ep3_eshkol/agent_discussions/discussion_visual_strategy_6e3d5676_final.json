    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Utilize distinct visual styles for each panel to further enhance the 'comic book' feel; for instance, a grittier, low-key lighting for the war room scene and brighter, more dynamic lighting for the victory montage. This visual contrast will emphasize the narrative progression., Employ sound design strategically to amplify emotional beats. A ticking clock for the countdown, sharp percussive sounds for 'Attack NOW!', a dramatic swell for Eshkol's decision, and an epic orchestral score for the victory montage will significantly enhance the impact and convey the desired emotions., Utilize split-screen effects during the 'Victory montage' to visually represent the 'Territory TRIPLES' and map expansion, reinforcing the scale of success with dynamic motion lines and sound design that mimics comic book impact effects.",
