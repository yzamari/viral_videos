00:00.000 --> 00:05.460
These little dragons make close
formations, just like Cauchy sequences

00:05.760 --> 00:06.069
limit.

00:06.069 --> 00:09.469
They always cluster within any tiny
epsilon box we give them.

00:09.769 --> 00:14.079
For real numbers, being Cauchy means they
are guaranteed to converge to

00:14.379 --> 00:14.867
something.

00:14.867 --> 00:20.231
Compactness, like Heine-Borel, means we
can cover everything with finite blankets,

00:20.531 --> 00:21.203
no holes!

00:21.203 --> 00:25.912
Dedekind cuts define real numbers, showing
how Cauchy completion makes our number
