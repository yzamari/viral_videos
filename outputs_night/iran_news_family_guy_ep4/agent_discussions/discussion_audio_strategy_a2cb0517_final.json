    "final_approach": "Based on agent discussion, the recommended approach combines: Employ distinct, slightly exaggerated voice actors for Maryam, the teenager, and the IT minister. Ensure clear audio separation and timing for each dialogue segment, fitting each within 3-5 seconds., Synchronize the 'Pigeons carrying USB drives' cutaway with a quick, subtle pigeon coo followed by a data transfer sound. The news ticker 'BREAKING: Youth Discover Books Exist' needs a sharp, attention-grabbing sound effect. The flickering lights should be paired with a crackling, electrical hum leading into Maryam's flask sip., Implement distinct, exaggerated voice acting for Maryam, the teenager, and the IT minister, with each voice clearly differentiated to enhance character recognition and comedic effect.",
